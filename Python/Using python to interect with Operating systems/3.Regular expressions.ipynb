    "## Regular Expressions in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "### Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Regular expressions (regex) are powerful tools used for pattern matching and text manipulation. They allow you to search, edit, and manipulate text based on specific patterns. Python provides the `re` module, which includes functions for working with regular expressions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Basic Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Pattern**: A sequence of characters that defines a search pattern.\n",
    "- **String**: The text to be searched.\n",
    "- **Match**: The process of comparing a regex pattern with a string.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Special Characters and Their Meaning\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **`.`**: Matches any single character except newline.\n",
    "2. **`^`**: Matches the start of a string.\n",
    "3. **`$`**: Matches the end of a string.\n",
    "4. **`*`**: Matches 0 or more repetitions of the preceding element.\n",
    "5. **`+`**: Matches 1 or more repetitions of the preceding element.\n",
    "6. **`?`**: Matches 0 or 1 repetition of the preceding element.\n",
    "7. **`{m}`**: Matches exactly `m` repetitions of the preceding element.\n",
    "8. **`{m,n}`**: Matches between `m` and `n` repetitions of the preceding element.\n",
    "9. **`[]`**: Matches any one of the characters inside the brackets.\n",
    "10. **`|`**: Matches either the pattern before or the pattern after the `|`.\n",
    "11. **`()`**: Groups patterns together and captures the matched text.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Character Classes\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **`\\d`**: Matches any digit; equivalent to `[0-9]`.\n",
    "2. **`\\D`**: Matches any non-digit; equivalent to `[^0-9]`.\n",
    "3. **`\\w`**: Matches any word character (alphanumeric + underscore); equivalent to `[a-zA-Z0-9_]`.\n",
    "4. **`\\W`**: Matches any non-word character; equivalent to `[^a-zA-Z0-9_]`.\n",
    "5. **`\\s`**: Matches any whitespace character (spaces, tabs, newlines).\n",
    "6. **`\\S`**: Matches any non-whitespace character.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Common Functions in the `re` Module\n",
    "\n",
    "#### `re.compile(pattern, flags=0)`\n",
    "\n",
    "Compiles a regular expression pattern into a regex object, which can be used for matching. Flags modify the behavior of the regex.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`re.IGNORECASE`**: Ignore case.\n",
    "- **`re.MULTILINE`**: Make `^` and `$` match the start and end of each line.\n",
    "- **`re.DOTALL`**: Make `.` match any character, including newlines.\n",
    "- **`re.VERBOSE`**: Allow verbose regex for better readability.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import re\n",
    "\n",
    "pattern = re.compile(r'\\d+')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### `re.match(pattern, string)`\n",
    "\n",
    "Determines if the regex matches at the start of the string.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "result = re.match(r'\\d+', '123abc')\n",

    "result = re.search(r'\\d+', 'abc123def')\n",
    "if result:\n",
    "    print(result.group())\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### `re.findall(pattern, string)`\n",
    "\n",
    "Finds all substrings where the regex pattern matches and returns them as a list.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "result = re.findall(r'\\d+', 'abc123def456')\n",
    "print(result)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### `re.finditer(pattern, string)`\n",
    "\n",
    "Finds all substrings where the regex pattern matches and returns them as an iterator of match objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "for match in re.finditer(r'\\d+', 'abc123def456'):\n",
    "    print(match.group())\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### `re.sub(pattern, repl, string)`\n",
    "\n",
    "Replaces the matches with the replacement text.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "result = re.sub(r'\\d+', 'NUMBER', 'abc123def456')\n",
    "print(result)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### `re.split(pattern, string)`\n",
    "\n",
    "Splits the string by the occurrences of the pattern.\n",

    "print(result)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Match Objects\n",
    "\n",
    "When a pattern matches a string, a match object is returned. The match object provides information about the match.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Methods of Match Objects\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`group()`**: Returns the matched text.\n",
    "- **`start()`**: Returns the start index of the match.\n",
    "- **`end()`**: Returns the end index of the match.\n",
    "- **`span()`**: Returns a tuple containing the start and end indices.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "match = re.search(r'\\d+', 'abc123def')\n",
    "if match:\n",
    "    print(match.group())\n",
    "    print(match.start())\n",
    "    print(match.end())\n",
    "    print(match.span())\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Advanced Topics\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Lookahead and Lookbehind\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Positive Lookahead `(?=...)`**: Asserts that what follows the regex must match the lookahead pattern.\n",
    "- **Negative Lookahead `(?!...)`**: Asserts that what follows the regex must not match the lookahead pattern.\n",
    "- **Positive Lookbehind `(?<=...)`**: Asserts that what precedes the regex must match the lookbehind pattern.\n",
    "- **Negative Lookbehind `(?<!...)`**: Asserts that what precedes the regex must not match the lookbehind pattern.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Positive Lookahead\n",
    "result = re.search(r'abc(?=\\d)', 'abc123')\n",
    "if result:\n",
    "    print(result.group())\n",
    "\n",
    "# Negative Lookahead\n",
    "result = re.search(r'abc(?!\\d)', 'abc123')\n",
    "if not result:\n",
    "    print(\"No match\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Positive Lookbehind\n",
    "result = re.search(r'(?<=abc)\\d+', 'abc123')\n",
    "if result:\n",

    "if result:\n",
    "    print(result.group())\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Non-capturing Groups\n",
    "\n",
    "Non-capturing groups are useful when you want to group parts of the regex without capturing the matched text.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "result = re.search(r'(?:abc)\\d+', 'abc123')\n",
    "if result:\n",
    "    print(result.group())\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Named Groups\n",
    "\n",
    "Named groups allow you to assign a name to a capturing group.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "pattern = re.compile(r'(?P<word>\\w+)\\s+(?P<digit>\\d+)')\n",
    "match = pattern.search('abc 123')\n",
    "if match:\n",
    "    print(match.group('word'))\n",
    "    print(match.group('digit'))\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Verbose Mode\n",
    "\n",
    "Verbose mode allows you to write more readable regular expressions by allowing you to include whitespace and comments.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "pattern = re.compile(r\"\"\"\n",
    "    \\d+  # Match one or more digits\n",
    "    \\s+  # Followed by one or more spaces\n",
    "    \\w+  # Followed by one or more word characters\n",
    "    \"\"\", re.VERBOSE)\n",
    "\n",
    "result = pattern.search('123 abc')\n",
    "if result:\n",
    "    print(result.group())\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Examples\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Email Validation**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "email_pattern = re.compile(r'^[a-zA-Z0-9_.+-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9-]+\\.[a-zA-Z0-9-.]+$')\n",
    "result = email_pattern.match('example@example.com')\n",

    "if result:\n",
    "    print(\"Valid phone number\")\n",
    "else:\n",
    "    print(\"Invalid phone number\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Extracting URLs from Text**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "text = 'Check out https://www.example.com and http://www.test.com'\n",
    "url_pattern = re.compile(r'https?://[a-zA-Z0-9./-]+')\n",
    "urls = url_pattern.findall(text)\n",
    "print(urls)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Password Strength Validation**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "password_pattern = re.compile(r'''\n",
    "    (?=.*[A-Z])       # at least one uppercase letter\n",
    "    (?=.*[a-z])       # at least one lowercase letter\n",
    "    (?=.*\\d)          # at least one digit\n",
    "    (?=.*[@$!%*?&])   # at least one special character\n",
    "    [A-Za-z\\d@$!%*?&]{8,}  # minimum length of 8 characters\n",
    "    ''', re.VERBOSE)\n",
    "\n",
    "result = password_pattern.match('StrongP@ssw0rd')\n",
    "if result:\n",
    "    print(\"Strong password\")\n",
    "else:\n",
    "    print(\"Weak password\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "Regular expressions are versatile and powerful for text processing tasks. By mastering regex, you can efficiently search, validate, and manipulate text data. Remember to use tools like `re.compile` and various regex flags to simplify your regex patterns and improve their readability. Regular expressions may have a steep learning curve, but with practice, they become an invaluable skill for any Python developer.\n",

    "## Escaping Characters in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "### Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Escaping characters in Python, especially within regular expressions, is crucial for accurately matching specific characters that have special meanings in regex syntax. This guide covers the various methods and techniques for escaping characters in Python, with a focus on regular expressions using the `re` module.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Understanding Special Characters\n",
    "\n",
    "Regular expressions use certain characters as metacharacters, which have special meanings. Some common metacharacters include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `.` (dot)\n",
    "- `^` (caret)\n",
    "- `$` (dollar sign)\n",
    "- `*` (asterisk)\n",
    "- `+` (plus)\n",
    "- `?` (question mark)\n",
    "- `{}` (curly braces)\n",
    "- `[]` (square brackets)\n",
    "- `()` (parentheses)\n",
    "- `|` (pipe)\n",
    "- `\\` (backslash)\n",
    "\n",
    "To match these characters literally, you need to escape them.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Escaping Special Characters\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python regular expressions, you escape a special character by preceding it with a backslash (`\\`). This tells the regex engine to treat the metacharacter as a literal character.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example: Matching a Literal Dot\n",
    "\n",
    "To match a literal dot (`.`), which normally matches any character except a newline:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import re\n",
    "\n",
    "pattern = r\"\\.\"\n",
    "text = \"www.example.com\"\n",
    "matches = re.findall(pattern, text)\n",
    "print(matches)  # Output: ['.', '.']\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Escaping Backslashes\n",
    "\n",
    "Backslashes are used for escaping characters, so to match a literal backslash (`\\`), you need to escape it with another backslash:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "pattern = r\"\\\\\"\n",
    "text = \"C:\\\\path\\\\to\\\\file\"\n",
    "matches = re.findall(pattern, text)\n",
    "print(matches)  # Output: ['\\\\', '\\\\']\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Common Escaped Characters in Regular Expressions\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some commonly escaped characters and their usage:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `\\.`: Matches a literal dot.\n",
    "- `\\\\`: Matches a literal backslash.\n",
    "- `\\*`: Matches a literal asterisk.\n",
    "- `\\+`: Matches a literal plus.\n",
    "- `\\?`: Matches a literal question mark.\n",
    "- `\\{`: Matches a literal opening curly brace.\n",
    "- `\\}`: Matches a literal closing curly brace.\n",
    "- `\\(`: Matches a literal opening parenthesis.\n",
    "- `\\)`: Matches a literal closing parenthesis.\n",
    "- `\\[`: Matches a literal opening square bracket.\n",
    "- `\\]`: Matches a literal closing square bracket.\n",
    "- `\\|`: Matches a literal pipe.\n",
    "- `\\^`: Matches a literal caret.\n",
    "- `\\$`: Matches a literal dollar sign.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Escaping Inside Character Classes\n",
    "\n",
    "Inside character classes (square brackets `[]`), most metacharacters lose their special meaning, except for `\\`, `^`, `-`, and `]`. However, it's good practice to escape them for clarity.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "pattern = r\"[.\\*\\+\\?\\{\\}\\(\\)\\[\\]\\|\\\\]\"\n",
    "text = \". * + ? { } ( ) [ ] | \\\\\"\n",
    "matches = re.findall(pattern, text)\n",
    "print(matches)  # Output: ['.', '*', '+', '?', '{', '}', '(', ')', '[', ']', '|', '\\\\']\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Using `re.escape()`\n",
    "\n",
    "The `re` module provides a convenient function, `re.escape()`, to escape all non-alphanumeric characters in a string automatically. This is particularly useful when constructing patterns from user input or variable data.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "pattern = re.escape(\".*+?{}()[]|\\\\\")\n",
    "text = \".*+?{}()[]|\\\\\"\n",
    "matches = re.findall(pattern, text)\n",
    "print(matches)  # Output: ['.*+?{}()[]|\\\\']\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Practical Examples of Escaping Characters\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Matching File Paths\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "pattern = r\"C:\\\\path\\\\to\\\\file\"\n",
    "text = \"C:\\\\path\\\\to\\\\file is the location.\"\n",
    "matches = re.findall(pattern, text)\n",
    "print(matches)  # Output: ['C:\\\\path\\\\to\\\\file']\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Matching URLs\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "pattern = r\"https?://www\\.example\\.com/\\S*\"\n",
    "text = \"Visit http://www.example.com/test or https://www.example.com/path.\"\n",
    "matches = re.findall(pattern, text)\n",
    "print(matches)  # Output: ['http://www.example.com/test', 'https://www.example.com/path']\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Matching Email Addresses with Escaped Characters\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "pattern = r\"[a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+\\.[a-zA-Z]{2,}\"\n",
    "text = \"Contact us at support@example.com or sales@example.co.uk.\"\n",
    "matches = re.findall(pattern, text)\n",
    "print(matches)  # Output: ['support@example.com', 'sales@example.co.uk']\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Combining Escaped Characters with Other Patterns\n",
    "\n",
    "You can combine escaped characters with other patterns to create more complex regular expressions.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example: Matching JavaScript Function Definitions\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "pattern = r\"function\\s+\\w+\\s*\\([^)]*\\)\\s*{[^}]*}\"\n",
    "text = \"function test(param) { console.log(param); }\"\n",
    "matches = re.findall(pattern, text)\n",
    "print(matches)  # Output: ['function test(param) { console.log(param); }']\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Special Characters**: Recognize the special characters in regular expressions and understand their roles.\n",
    "- **Escaping Characters**: Use a backslash (`\\`) to escape special characters and match them literally.\n",
    "- **Escaping Backslashes**: Double the backslash (`\\\\`) to match a literal backslash.\n",
    "- **Common Escaped Characters**: Familiarize yourself with the common escaped characters like `\\.` and `\\\\`.\n",

    "### Importing the Module\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import re\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Functions in the `re` Module\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "pattern = re.compile(r'\\d+')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Searching for a Pattern**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "match = re.search(r'\\d+', 'The number is 42')\n",
    "if match:\n",
    "    print(match.group())  # Output: 42\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Matching a Pattern at the Beginning**\n",
    "\n",

    "print(num_subs)    # Output: 2\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Advanced Usage\n",
    "\n",
    "### Flags\n",
    "\n",
    "Flags modify the behavior of regex functions. Common flags include:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **re.IGNORECASE (re.I)** - Makes the pattern case-insensitive.\n",
    "2. **re.MULTILINE (re.M)** - '^' and '$' match the start and end of each line.\n",
    "3. **re.DOTALL (re.S)** - '.' matches any character, including a newline.\n",
    "4. **re.VERBOSE (re.X)** - Allows for more readable regex by ignoring whitespace and comments within the pattern.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example with Flags\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "pattern = re.compile(r'^hello', re.I | re.M)\n",
    "matches = re.findall(pattern, 'Hello\\nhello\\nHello')\n",
    "print(matches)  # Output: ['Hello', 'hello', 'Hello']\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Named Groups\n",
    "\n",
    "Named groups allow for more readable code when working with multiple groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "pattern = re.compile(r'(?P<first>\\w+)\\s(?P<last>\\w+)')\n",
    "match = pattern.search('John Doe')\n",
    "if match:\n",
    "    print(match.group('first'))  # Output: John\n",
    "    print(match.group('last'))   # Output: Doe\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Non-capturing Groups\n",
    "\n",
    "Non-capturing groups are used when you need to group part of the regex but do not want to capture the matched text.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "pattern = re.compile(r'(?:\\d{3})-(\\d{2})-(\\d{4})')\n",
    "match = pattern.search('123-45-6789')\n",
    "if match:\n",
    "    print(match.group(1))  # Output: 45\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Lookahead and Lookbehind\n",
    "\n",
    "Lookahead and lookbehind assertions are used to assert that a certain pattern is followed or preceded by another pattern.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Positive Lookahead (?=...)**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "pattern = re.compile(r'\\d+(?= dollars)')\n",
    "match = pattern.search('100 dollars')\n",
    "if match:\n",
    "    print(match.group())  # Output: 100\n",

    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Splitting and replacing are two common operations in text processing. Regular expressions (regexes) provide powerful tools for performing these operations with high flexibility and precision. Python's `re` module offers methods like `re.split()` and `re.sub()` (and `re.subn()`) to split strings and replace substrings based on regex patterns.\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Splitting by Multiple Delimiters\n",
    "\n",
    "You can split a string by multiple delimiters by using a regex pattern that includes all desired delimiters.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",

    "\n",
    "### Using a Function as the Replacement\n",
    "\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Getting the Number of Replacements with `re.subn()`\n",
    "\n",
    "The `re.subn()` function works like `re.sub()` but returns a tuple containing the new string and the number of replacements made.\n",

    "```python\n",
    "import timeit\n",
    "\n",
    "setup = '''\n",
