    "### Comprehensive Notes on Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that uses \"objects\" to design applications and computer programs. It utilizes several key concepts, such as classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, and abstraction.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. **Classes and Objects**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Class**: A blueprint for creating objects. It defines a set of attributes and methods that the created objects will have.\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  class Dog:\n",
    "      def __init__(self, name, age):\n",
    "          self.name = name\n",
    "          self.age = age\n",
    "      \n",
    "      def bark(self):\n",
    "          print(f\"{self.name} is barking.\")\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Object**: An instance of a class.\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  my_dog = Dog(\"Rex\", 5)\n",
    "  print(my_dog.name)  # Output: Rex\n",
    "  my_dog.bark()  # Output: Rex is barking.\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. **Attributes and Methods**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Attributes**: Variables that belong to an object or class.\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  class Car:\n",
    "      def __init__(self, make, model, year):\n",
    "          self.make = make\n",
    "          self.model = model\n",
    "          self.year = year\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Methods**: Functions that are defined within a class and describe the behaviors of the objects.\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  class Car:\n",
    "      def __init__(self, make, model, year):\n",
    "          self.make = make\n",
    "          self.model = model\n",
    "          self.year = year\n",
    "      \n",
    "      def start_engine(self):\n",
    "          print(f\"The {self.make} {self.model}'s engine is starting.\")\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. **Encapsulation**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Encapsulation is the mechanism of restricting access to some of the object's components. This is usually done to prevent accidental modification of data.\n",
    "  - **Private Attributes**: By convention, private attributes are prefixed with an underscore (`_`).\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  class Person:\n",
    "      def __init__(self, name, age):\n",
    "          self._name = name  # private attribute\n",
    "          self._age = age  # private attribute\n",
    "      \n",
    "      def display(self):\n",
    "          print(f\"Name: {self._name}, Age: {self._age}\")\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. **Inheritance**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Inheritance allows a class to inherit attributes and methods from another class.\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  class Animal:\n",
    "      def __init__(self, name):\n",
    "          self.name = name\n",
    "      \n",
    "      def eat(self):\n",
    "          print(f\"{self.name} is eating.\")\n",
    "  \n",
    "  class Cat(Animal):\n",
    "      def meow(self):\n",
    "          print(f\"{self.name} says meow.\")\n",
    "  \n",
    "  my_cat = Cat(\"Whiskers\")\n",
    "  my_cat.eat()  # Output: Whiskers is eating.\n",
    "  my_cat.meow()  # Output: Whiskers says meow.\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 5. **Polymorphism**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Polymorphism allows methods to do different things based on the object it is acting upon.\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  class Bird:\n",
    "      def speak(self):\n",
    "          print(\"Bird is making a sound.\")\n",
    "  \n",
    "  class Parrot(Bird):\n",
    "      def speak(self):\n",
    "          print(\"Parrot is talking.\")\n",
    "  \n",
    "  class Penguin(Bird):\n",
    "      def speak(self):\n",
    "          print(\"Penguin is squawking.\")\n",
    "  \n",
    "  def make_bird_speak(bird):\n",
    "      bird.speak()\n",
    "  \n",
    "  make_bird_speak(Parrot())  # Output: Parrot is talking.\n",
    "  make_bird_speak(Penguin())  # Output: Penguin is squawking.\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 6. **Abstraction**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Abstraction means hiding the complex implementation details and showing only the necessary features of the object.\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  from abc import ABC, abstractmethod\n",
    "  \n",
    "  class Shape(ABC):\n",
    "      @abstractmethod\n",
    "      def area(self):\n",
    "          pass\n",
    "  \n",
    "  class Rectangle(Shape):\n",
    "      def __init__(self, width, height):\n",
    "          self.width = width\n",
    "          self.height = height\n",
    "      \n",
    "      def area(self):\n",
    "          return self.width * self.height\n",
    "  \n",
    "  rect = Rectangle(10, 20)\n",
    "  print(rect.area())  # Output: 200\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 7. **Constructor and Destructor**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Constructor**: `__init__` method is called when an object is created. It's used for initializing the object's state.\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  class Employee:\n",
    "      def __init__(self, name, id):\n",
    "          self.name = name\n",
    "          self.id = id\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Destructor**: `__del__` method is called when an object is destroyed. Itâ€™s used for cleanup actions.\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  class Employee:\n",
    "      def __del__(self):\n",
    "          print(f\"Employee {self.name} with ID {self.id} is being deleted.\")\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 8. **Static Methods and Class Methods**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Static Methods**: Defined with `@staticmethod` decorator, they don't modify object state and are called on the class itself.\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  class Math:\n",
    "      @staticmethod\n",
    "      def add(a, b):\n",
    "          return a + b\n",
    "  \n",
    "  print(Math.add(5, 3))  # Output: 8\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Class Methods**: Defined with `@classmethod` decorator, they have access to the class itself but not the instance.\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  class Employee:\n",
    "      num_of_employees = 0\n",
    "      \n",
    "      def __init__(self, name):\n",
    "          self.name = name\n",
    "          Employee.num_of_employees += 1\n",
    "      \n",
    "      @classmethod\n",
    "      def get_num_of_employees(cls):\n",
    "          return cls.num_of_employees\n",
    "  \n",
    "  emp1 = Employee(\"John\")\n",
    "  emp2 = Employee(\"Jane\")\n",
    "  print(Employee.get_num_of_employees())  # Output: 2\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 9. **Property Decorators**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Property decorators (`@property`) provide a way to control access to an attribute by defining methods that get and set its value.\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  class Person:\n",
    "      def __init__(self, name):\n",
    "          self._name = name\n",
    "      \n",
    "      @property\n",
    "      def name(self):\n",
    "          return self._name\n",
    "      \n",
    "      @name.setter\n",
    "      def name(self, value):\n",
    "          self._name = value\n",
    "  \n",
    "  person = Person(\"Alice\")\n",
    "  print(person.name)  # Output: Alice\n",
    "  person.name = \"Bob\"\n",
    "  print(person.name)  # Output: Bob\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 10. **Inheritance and Method Resolution Order (MRO)**\n",
    "\n",
    "- MRO determines the order in which base classes are looked up when searching for a method.\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  class A:\n",
    "      def process(self):\n",
    "          print(\"Process in A\")\n",

    "### Comprehensive Notes on Polymorphism in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "Polymorphism is a fundamental concept in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) that allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. It enables methods to do different things based on the object it is acting upon, promoting flexibility and integration of code.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. **Understanding Polymorphism**\n",
    "\n",
    "Polymorphism means \"many shapes\" and it allows the same function or method to be used on different objects. The specific implementation that is executed depends on the object the method is called on.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. **Types of Polymorphism**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Compile-time Polymorphism (Overloading)**:\n",
    "- Not natively supported in Python. It involves having multiple functions with the same name but different parameters. \n",
    "- Achievable through default parameters or variable-length arguments.\n",

    "**Run-time Polymorphism (Overriding)**:\n",
    "- Supported in Python. It involves methods in a child class that have the same name as methods in the parent class.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. **Polymorphism with Inheritance**\n",
    "\n",
    "Polymorphism is often used with inheritance where derived classes override methods of a base class.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Animal:\n",
    "    def sound(self):\n",
    "        pass\n",

    "#### 6. **Duck Typing**\n",
    "\n",
    "Pythonâ€™s dynamic nature allows for a type of polymorphism known as \"duck typing.\" If an object behaves like a duck (has the necessary methods/attributes), it is treated as a duck, regardless of its actual type.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Bird:\n",
    "    def fly(self):\n",
    "        return \"Flying\"\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 7. **Operator Overloading**\n",
    "\n",
    "Python allows the same operator to have different meanings based on the operands. This is another form of polymorphism.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",

    "\n",
    "v1 = Vector(2, 3)\n",
    "v2 = Vector(3, 4)\n",
    "\n",
    "v3 = v1 + v2  # Uses the __add__ method\n",
    "print(v3)  # Output: (5, 7)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 8. **Method Overriding**\n",
    "\n",
    "Method overriding is a key aspect of polymorphism. It allows a subclass to provide a specific implementation of a method that is already defined in its superclass.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Parent:\n",
    "    def show(self):\n",
    "        return \"Parent show method\"\n",
    "\n",
    "class Child(Parent):\n",
    "    def show(self):\n",
    "        return \"Child show method\"\n",
    "\n",
    "obj = Child()\n",
    "print(obj.show())  # Output: Child show method\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 9. **Benefits of Polymorphism**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Code Reusability**: Polymorphism promotes reusability by allowing the same interface to be used for different data types.\n",
    "- **Extensibility**: New functionality can be easily added by introducing new classes that implement the same interface.\n",
    "- **Maintainability**: Polymorphic code tends to be more maintainable due to its modular nature.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 10. **Real-World Example**\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider a shape drawing application where you have different shapes like circles, squares, and triangles. Each shape can be drawn using a `draw` method.\n",

    "# Output:\n",
    "# Drawing Circle\n",
    "# Drawing Square\n",
    "# Drawing Triangle\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, polymorphism allows the `draw` method to be called on different shapes without knowing their exact type.\n",

    "    ```python\n",
    "    from module_name import *\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    - Generally discouraged to avoid namespace pollution.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Module Search Path**:\n",
    "  - Python searches for modules in directories listed in `sys.path`.\n",
    "  - `sys.path` includes the current directory, Python's built-in modules, and directories specified by the `PYTHONPATH` environment variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Standard Library Modules**:\n",
    "  - Python comes with a rich set of standard library modules (`math`, `os`, `datetime`, etc.).\n",
    "  - These modules provide functionalities for common tasks without needing external installations.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. **Packages**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Packages** are directories that contain multiple modules and a special `__init__.py` file. They provide a hierarchical structure to organize Python modules.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Creating a Package**:\n",
    "  - Create a directory with a valid Python name (preferably lowercase).\n",
    "  - Add an `__init__.py` file (can be empty or contain initialization code).\n",
    "  - Include multiple module files within the package directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Importing Packages and Modules**:\n",
    "  - **Importing Modules from a Package**:\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    import package_name.module_name\n",
    "    ```\n",

    "  \n",
    "  - **Importing Specific Items from Modules**:\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    from package_name.module_name import function_name, variable_name\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Relative Imports**:\n",
    "  - Allows importing modules relative to the current moduleâ€™s location within the package.\n",
    "  - Use dot notation to specify relative paths: `from . import module_name`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Subpackages**:\n",
    "  - Packages can contain subpackages, creating a hierarchical structure.\n",
    "  - Example: `package_name.subpackage.module_name`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. **Special Module Attributes**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`__name__`**: Specifies the moduleâ€™s name. For the main module, it is `\"__main__\"`.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **`__file__`**: Contains the path to the moduleâ€™s source file (not present in built-in modules).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`__doc__`**: Holds the moduleâ€™s docstring (if defined).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`__package__`**: Indicates the moduleâ€™s package name (for modules inside packages).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 5. **Using `__init__.py`**\n",
    "\n",
    "- The `__init__.py` file is executed when the package or module is imported.\n",
    "- It can initialize package-level variables, set up resources, or import specific modules.\n",
    "- It can be empty if no initialization is needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 6. **Standard Library vs External Packages**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Standard Library**:\n",
    "  - Included with Python installation.\n",
    "  - Doesnâ€™t require additional installation steps.\n",
    "  - Example: `os`, `sys`, `datetime`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **External Packages**:\n",
    "  - Developed and maintained by the community.\n",
    "  - Managed and installed using tools like `pip`.\n",
    "  - Examples: `requests`, `numpy`, `pandas`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 7. **Module and Package Best Practices**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Organize Code Logically**: Split code into modules based on functionality.\n",
    "- **Use Descriptive Names**: Name modules and packages clearly.\n",

    "### Comprehensive Notes on `__name__` and `__main__` in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. **Introduction**\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, `__name__` and `__main__` are special variables that help in managing the execution of code. Understanding these variables is crucial for writing scripts and modules that can be both reusable and executable.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **The `__name__` Variable**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2.1 What is `__name__`?\n",
    "\n",
    "- `__name__` is a built-in variable that Python automatically defines.\n",
    "- It contains a string that indicates the name of the current module.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2.2 Possible Values of `__name__`\n",
    "\n",
    "- When a module is run directly (e.g., using `python module.py`), `__name__` is set to `\"__main__\"`.\n",
    "- When a module is imported, `__name__` is set to the module's name.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2.3 Using `__name__` in Code\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# my_module.py\n",
    "\n",
    "def my_function():\n",
    "    print(\"Function in my_module\")\n",
    "\n",
    "print(\"my_module __name__:\", __name__)\n",
    "\n",
    "if __name__ == \"__main__\":\n",
    "    print(\"my_module is being run directly\")\n",
    "else:\n",
    "    print(\"my_module has been imported\")\n",
    "```\n",

    "\n",
    "#### 3.1 What is `__main__`?\n",
    "\n",
    "- `__main__` is the name of the top-level script environment.\n",
    "- It acts as an entry point for the program.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3.2 Common Use Case\n",
    "\n",
    "- Writing code that should only execute when the script is run directly, not when it is imported as a module.\n",
    "- This is typically done to allow modules to define functions, classes, and variables without executing code unintentionally.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3.3 The `if __name__ == \"__main__\":` Construct\n",
    "\n",
    "- This construct is used to check whether the module is being run directly or imported.\n",
    "- Code within this block only executes if the module is run as the main program.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# main_module.py\n",
    "\n",
    "def main():\n",

    "\n",
    "#### 4.1 Reusability\n",
    "\n",
    "- Allows the module's functions and classes to be reused without executing the script code.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4.2 Modularity\n",
    "\n",
    "- Enhances the modularity of code by separating the executable part from the importable part.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4.3 Testing and Debugging\n",
