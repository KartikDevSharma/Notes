    "### Comprehensive Notes on Errors and Exception Handling in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. **Introduction**\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, errors and exceptions are part of the language's runtime behavior. Proper handling of these events is crucial for building robust and reliable applications. This guide covers the types of errors, how to handle exceptions, and best practices for error handling.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **Types of Errors**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2.1 Syntax Errors\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Syntax Errors** occur when the Python parser detects incorrect syntax.\n",
    "- They are often raised at compile time before execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Syntax Error: Missing colon\n",
    "if True\n",
    "    print(\"This will cause a syntax error\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2.2 Runtime Errors (Exceptions)\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Runtime Errors** are detected during execution.\n",
    "- They include various built-in exceptions that can be handled using try-except blocks.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Common Runtime Errors:**\n",
    "- `ZeroDivisionError`: Division by zero.\n",
    "- `NameError`: Using a variable that has not been defined.\n",
    "- `TypeError`: Performing an operation on incompatible types.\n",
    "- `IndexError`: Indexing a list or array out of range.\n",
    "- `KeyError`: Accessing a non-existent key in a dictionary.\n",
    "- `ValueError`: Passing an argument of the right type but inappropriate value.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Runtime Error: ZeroDivisionError\n",
    "result = 10 / 0\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. **Exception Handling**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3.1 The `try` and `except` Blocks\n",
    "\n",
    "- The `try` block allows you to test a block of code for errors.\n",
    "- The `except` block enables you to handle the error.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Syntax:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    # Code that may cause an exception\n",
    "except ExceptionType:\n",
    "    # Code to handle the exception\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    result = 10 / 0\n",
    "except ZeroDivisionError:\n",
    "    print(\"Cannot divide by zero\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3.2 Multiple Except Blocks\n",
    "\n",
    "- You can handle different exceptions separately using multiple except blocks.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    result = 10 / 0\n",
    "except ZeroDivisionError:\n",
    "    print(\"Cannot divide by zero\")\n",
    "except TypeError:\n",
    "    print(\"Invalid type\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3.3 The `else` Block\n",
    "\n",
    "- The `else` block executes if the try block does not raise an exception.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    result = 10 / 2\n",
    "except ZeroDivisionError:\n",
    "    print(\"Cannot divide by zero\")\n",
    "else:\n",
    "    print(\"The result is\", result)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3.4 The `finally` Block\n",
    "\n",
    "- The `finally` block executes regardless of whether an exception is raised or not.\n",
    "- It is typically used for cleanup actions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    result = 10 / 0\n",
    "except ZeroDivisionError:\n",
    "    print(\"Cannot divide by zero\")\n",
    "finally:\n",
    "    print(\"This will always execute\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3.5 Catching Multiple Exceptions\n",
    "\n",
    "- You can handle multiple exceptions in a single except block by using a tuple.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    result = 10 / 0\n",
    "except (ZeroDivisionError, TypeError):\n",
    "    print(\"An error occurred\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3.6 Catching All Exceptions\n",
    "\n",
    "- Using `except Exception` can catch all exceptions, but it is generally discouraged because it can catch unexpected errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    result = 10 / 0\n",
    "except Exception as e:\n",
    "    print(\"An error occurred:\", e)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. **Raising Exceptions**\n",
    "\n",
    "- You can raise exceptions using the `raise` keyword.\n",
    "- This is useful for custom error handling and validation.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Syntax:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "raise ExceptionType(\"Error message\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def check_positive(number):\n",
    "    if number <= 0:\n",
    "        raise ValueError(\"Number must be positive\")\n",
    "    return number\n",
    "\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    check_positive(-1)\n",
    "except ValueError as e:\n",
    "    print(e)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. **Custom Exceptions**\n",
    "\n",
    "- You can define custom exceptions by creating a new class that inherits from the `Exception` class.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class CustomError(Exception):\n",
    "    pass\n",
    "\n",
    "def check_value(value):\n",
    "    if value < 0:\n",
    "        raise CustomError(\"Value cannot be negative\")\n",
    "\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    check_value(-1)\n",
    "except CustomError as e:\n",
    "    print(e)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. **Best Practices for Exception Handling**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 6.1 Be Specific with Exceptions\n",
    "\n",
    "- Catch specific exceptions rather than using a broad `except Exception`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 6.2 Avoid Bare Excepts\n",
    "\n",
    "- Avoid using `except:` without specifying an exception type.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 6.3 Use Finally for Cleanup\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use the `finally` block to clean up resources, such as closing files or releasing locks.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 6.4 Log Exceptions\n",
    "\n",
    "- Logging exceptions can help with debugging and monitoring application health.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import logging\n",
    "\n",
    "logging.basicConfig(filename='app.log', level=logging.ERROR)\n",
    "\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    result = 10 / 0\n",
    "except ZeroDivisionError as e:\n",
    "    logging.error(\"ZeroDivisionError occurred\", exc_info=True)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 6.5 Validate Inputs\n",
    "\n",
    "- Perform input validation to catch potential errors early.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def divide(a, b):\n",
    "    if b == 0:\n",
    "        raise ValueError(\"Denominator cannot be zero\")\n",
    "    return a / b\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 6.6 Document Exception Handling\n",
    "\n",
    "- Document the exceptions that your functions can raise and how they should be handled.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7. **Summary**\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding and properly handling exceptions is essential for developing robust Python applications. By using try-except blocks, raising appropriate exceptions, defining custom exceptions, and following best practices, you can ensure your code is resilient and easier to debug and maintain.\n",

    "### 2. **Basic Concepts of `unittest`**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2.1 Test Case\n",
    "\n",
    "- A **Test Case** is the smallest unit of testing. It checks for a specific response to a particular set of inputs.\n",
    "- In `unittest`, test cases are represented by the `unittest.TestCase` class.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2.2 Test Suite\n",
    "\n",
    "- A **Test Suite** is a collection of test cases, test suites, or both.\n",
    "- It is used to aggregate tests that should be executed together.\n",

    "### Comprehensive Notes on Python Decorators\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. **Introduction to Decorators**\n",
    "\n",
    "A **decorator** in Python is a design pattern that allows a user to add new functionality to an existing object without modifying its structure. Decorators are usually called before the definition of a function you want to decorate.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **Basic Concepts**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2.1 Functions as First-Class Objects\n",
    "\n",
    "- In Python, functions are first-class objects. This means that functions can be passed around and used as arguments, just like any other object (string, int, float, list, etc.).\n",
    "  \n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def greet(name):\n",
    "    return f\"Hello, {name}!\"\n",
    "\n",
    "greet_someone = greet\n",
    "print(greet_someone(\"Alice\"))  # Output: Hello, Alice!\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2.2 Inner Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "- You can define functions inside other functions. Such functions are called inner functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def outer_function():\n",
    "    def inner_function():\n",
    "        print(\"Hello from the inner function!\")\n",
    "    inner_function()\n",

    "### 3. **Decorators**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3.1 Defining a Simple Decorator\n",
    "\n",
    "- A decorator is a function that takes another function as an argument, adds some functionality to it, and returns another function.\n",

    "\n",
    "decorated_function = my_decorator(say_hello)\n",
    "decorated_function()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3.2 Using the `@` Syntax\n",
    "\n",
    "- Python provides a convenient syntax for decorators using the `@` symbol, which is placed above the function to be decorated.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def my_decorator(func):\n",
    "    def wrapper():\n",
    "        print(\"Something is happening before the function is called.\")\n",

    "\n",
    "### 5. **Class-Based Decorators**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Decorators can also be implemented as classes. A class-based decorator implements the `__call__` method.\n",

    "\n",
    "**Generators** are a type of iterable in Python, like lists or tuples. Unlike lists, they do not store their contents in memory; instead, they generate items on-the-fly. This makes them more memory-efficient and suitable for large datasets.\n",

    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def simple_generator():\n",

    "- **Memory Usage**: Generators are more memory-efficient as they yield items one by one rather than storing them all in memory.\n",
    "- **Execution Time**: Lists are faster for multiple iterations over the data, while generators are more suitable for single-pass iteration.\n",
    "- **Infinite Sequences**: Generators can represent infinite sequences, while lists cannot.\n",

    "### Python `collections` Module: `OrderedDict`\n",
    "\n",
    "The `collections` module in Python provides alternative container datatypes. One of these is the `OrderedDict`, which is a dictionary that remembers the order in which its contents are added. Here are the comprehensive notes on `OrderedDict`:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Overview of `OrderedDict`\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Purpose**: An `OrderedDict` is a dictionary subclass that maintains the order of the keys as they were added. This is useful for tasks that require the elements to be processed in a specific order.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Importing**: You need to import it from the `collections` module:\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  from collections import OrderedDict\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Creating an `OrderedDict`\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Initialization**: An `OrderedDict` can be created just like a regular dictionary:\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  od = OrderedDict()\n",
    "  od['a'] = 1\n",
    "  od['b'] = 2\n",
    "  od['c'] = 3\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **From a list of tuples**: You can also initialize an `OrderedDict` from a list of key-value pairs (tuples):\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  items = [('a', 1), ('b', 2), ('c', 3)]\n",
    "  od = OrderedDict(items)\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Characteristics and Behavior\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Order Maintenance**: The `OrderedDict` maintains the order of insertion. This is different from a regular dictionary prior to Python 3.7, where order was not guaranteed (though starting from Python 3.7, regular dictionaries also maintain insertion order).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Equality**: Two `OrderedDict` instances are considered equal if they contain the same key-value pairs in the same order.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Common Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`move_to_end`**: This method moves an existing key to either the end (default) or the beginning of the dictionary:\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  od.move_to_end('b')        # Move 'b' to the end\n",
    "  od.move_to_end('b', last=False)  # Move 'b' to the beginning\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`popitem`**: This method removes and returns a key-value pair from the dictionary. The last item is removed by default:\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  od.popitem()               # Removes and returns the last item\n",
    "  od.popitem(last=False)     # Removes and returns the first item\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`pop`**: Works like the standard dictionary `pop` method, removing and returning the value for a specified key:\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  value = od.pop('a')\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Iteration**: Iterating over an `OrderedDict` yields its keys in the order they were added:\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  for key in od:\n",
    "      print(key, od[key])\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Use Cases\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Ordered data**: When the order of elements is important, such as in caching mechanisms, maintaining insertion order, or building complex data structures where order matters.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Pretty Printing**: For tasks where the order of elements needs to be predictable, making the output easier to read and understand.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Serialization**: Ensuring that the serialized data structure maintains a consistent order across different runs.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example Usage\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from collections import OrderedDict\n",
    "\n",
    "# Initialize an OrderedDict\n",

    "\n",
    "#### Overview of `defaultdict`\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Purpose**: A `defaultdict` is similar to a regular dictionary, but it provides a default value for the key that does not exist. This avoids `KeyError` exceptions and makes it easier to handle missing keys.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Importing**: You need to import it from the `collections` module:\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  from collections import defaultdict\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Creating a `defaultdict`\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Initialization**: When creating a `defaultdict`, you must provide a default factory function that returns the default value for nonexistent keys.\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  dd = defaultdict(int)  # Default value is 0\n",
    "  dd = defaultdict(list) # Default value is an empty list\n",
    "  dd = defaultdict(lambda: \"default\")  # Default value is \"default\"\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Behavior**: When you access or assign a value to a key that does not exist in the dictionary, `defaultdict` automatically creates an entry for that key with the default value provided by the factory function.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Common Use Cases\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Counting**: Using `defaultdict` with `int` can be very handy for counting occurrences of items.\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  from collections import defaultdict\n",
    "\n",
    "  s = \"mississippi\"\n",
    "  dd = defaultdict(int)\n",
    "  for char in s:\n",
    "      dd[char] += 1\n",
    "  print(dd)\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Grouping**: Using `defaultdict` with `list` or `set` can help in grouping items.\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  from collections import defaultdict\n",
    "\n",
    "  names = [(\"Alice\", \"A\"), (\"Bob\", \"B\"), (\"Charlie\", \"A\"), (\"Dave\", \"B\")]\n",

    "  for name, group in names:\n",
    "      dd[group].append(name)\n",
    "  print(dd)\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Methods and Properties\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`default_factory`**: The factory function that provides the default value. If this attribute is set to `None`, `defaultdict` behaves like a regular dictionary and raises a `KeyError` for missing keys.\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  dd = defaultdict(int)\n",
    "  print(dd.default_factory)  # <class 'int'>\n",
    "  dd.default_factory = None\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Accessing keys**: Accessing a missing key returns the default value and adds the key to the dictionary.\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  dd = defaultdict(list)\n",
    "  print(dd[\"missing_key\"])  # Returns []\n",
    "  print(dd)  # {'missing_key': []}\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`__missing__` method**: This method is automatically called by the `defaultdict` when a key is accessed that does not exist.\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  dd = defaultdict(int)\n",
    "  dd[\"new_key\"]  # Triggers the __missing__ method, adds 'new_key' with value 0\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example Usage\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from collections import defaultdict\n",
    "\n",
    "# Counting occurrences of characters in a string\n",
    "s = \"mississippi\"\n",

    "print(dd)  # defaultdict(<function <lambda> at 0x...>, {'key': 'default_value'})\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Performance Considerations\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Efficiency**: Accessing elements in a `defaultdict` is very efficient and similar to accessing elements in a regular dictionary.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "The `defaultdict` in Python's `collections` module is a powerful tool when you need to handle missing keys gracefully. It simplifies code that deals with dictionaries where some keys might not be present by providing a default value for those keys.

    "\n",
    "#### Overview of `ChainMap`\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Purpose**: A `ChainMap` is a class that groups multiple dictionaries or mappings into a single view. This allows you to manage multiple dictionaries as a single unit without merging them. \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Importing**: You need to import it from the `collections` module:\n",

    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Creating a `ChainMap`\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Initialization**: You can create a `ChainMap` by passing multiple dictionaries to it:\n",

    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Characteristics and Behavior\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Order of Dictionaries**: The order in which dictionaries are passed to `ChainMap` matters. The first dictionary has the highest priority, and subsequent dictionaries are checked in order if the key is not found in the previous ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Read and Write**: Reads are performed across all dictionaries, while writes (insertions, updates, and deletions) affect only the first dictionary.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Common Methods and Operations\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Accessing Values**: You can access values in a `ChainMap` using keys just like a normal dictionary.\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  print(chain['a'])  # Output: 1 (from dict1)\n",
    "  print(chain['b'])  # Output: 2 (from dict1, since it has higher priority)\n",
    "  print(chain['c'])  # Output: 4 (from dict2)\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Adding New Mappings**: New keys are added to the first dictionary.\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  chain['d'] = 5\n",
    "  print(dict1)  # {'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'd': 5}\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Updating Values**: Existing keys are updated in the first dictionary where they are found.\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  chain['b'] = 10\n",
    "  print(dict1)  # {'a': 1, 'b': 10, 'd': 5}\n",
    "  print(dict2)  # {'b': 3, 'c': 4}\n",
    "  ```\n",

    "  print(dict1)  # {'a': 1, 'd': 5}\n",
    "  print(dict2)  # {'b': 3, 'c': 4}\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Iteration**: Iterating over a `ChainMap` yields keys from all dictionaries, but each key appears only once, based on the highest-priority dictionary.\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  for key in chain:\n",
    "      print(key, chain[key])\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",

    "  ```python\n",
    "  print(list(chain.keys()))  # ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd']\n",
    "  print(list(chain.values()))  # [1, 10, 4, 5]\n",
    "  print(list(chain.items()))  # [('a', 1), ('b', 10), ('c', 4), ('d', 5)]\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Adding New Dictionaries**: You can add new dictionaries to an existing `ChainMap` using the `new_child` method.\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  dict3 = {'e': 6, 'f': 7}\n",
    "  new_chain = chain.new_child(dict3)\n",

    "### Python Debugger (`pdb`)\n",
    "\n",
    "The Python Debugger (`pdb`) is a powerful tool for debugging Python programs. It allows you to set breakpoints, step through code, inspect variables, and evaluate expressions in real-time. Here are comprehensive notes on using `pdb` effectively:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Overview of `pdb`\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Purpose**: `pdb` is a built-in module for interactive debugging of Python programs. It provides a command-line interface for stepping through code, inspecting variables, and controlling the execution flow.\n",
    "- **Importing**: You can import the module using:\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  import pdb\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Starting the Debugger\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Direct Invocation**:\n",
    "   - You can start the debugger from within your script by calling `pdb.set_trace()` at the desired location:\n",
    "     ```python\n",
    "     import pdb\n",
    "\n",
    "     def buggy_function(a, b):\n",
    "         pdb.set_trace()\n",
    "         result = a + b\n",
    "         return result\n",
    "\n",
    "     buggy_function(1, '2')\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "   - When the interpreter reaches `pdb.set_trace()`, it pauses execution and starts the interactive debugger.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Running a Script with `pdb`**:\n",
    "   - You can also run a script with `pdb` from the command line:\n",
    "     ```sh\n",
    "     python -m pdb myscript.py\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Using Breakpoints in IDEs**:\n",
    "   - Many IDEs, like PyCharm, VSCode, and others, have integrated debugging tools that provide a graphical interface for setting breakpoints and stepping through code.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Basic `pdb` Commands\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Navigating Code**:\n",
    "  - `c` (continue): Continue execution until the next breakpoint.\n",
    "  - `n` (next): Execute the next line of code.\n",
    "  - `s` (step): Step into a function.\n",
    "  - `r` (return): Continue execution until the current function returns.\n",
    "  - `b` (break): Set a breakpoint.\n",
    "  - `l` (list): List source code around the current line.\n",
    "  - `q` (quit): Exit the debugger and abort the program.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Inspecting Variables**:\n",
    "  - `p` (print): Print the value of an expression.\n",
    "  - `pp` (pretty-print): Pretty-print the value of an expression.\n",
    "  - `whatis`: Display the type of an expression.\n",
    "  - `display` / `undisplay`: Display the value of an expression each time the program stops.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Managing Breakpoints**:\n",
    "  - `b [lineno]`: Set a breakpoint at the specified line number.\n",
    "  - `b [filename]:[lineno]`: Set a breakpoint at the specified line in another file.\n",
    "  - `tbreak [lineno]`: Set a temporary breakpoint that is removed after it is hit.\n",
    "  - `cl` (clear): Clear all breakpoints or a specific one by number.\n",
    "  - `disable` / `enable`: Disable or enable breakpoints.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Execution Control**:\n",
    "  - `jump [lineno]`: Set the next line that will be executed (caution: can lead to unexpected behavior).\n",
    "  - `ignore [bpnumber] [count]`: Ignore the breakpoint `bpnumber` the next `count` times.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Examining the Call Stack**:\n",
    "  - `w` (where): Print a stack trace.\n",
    "  - `u` (up): Move up one level in the stack trace.\n",
    "  - `d` (down): Move down one level in the stack trace.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Advanced Usage\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Conditional Breakpoints**:\n",
    "   - Set a breakpoint that only triggers when a condition is true:\n",
    "     ```sh\n",
    "     (Pdb) b 10, x > 5\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "   - This sets a breakpoint at line 10 that only stops execution if `x > 5`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Post-Mortem Debugging**:\n",
    "   - Debug after an exception has occurred:\n",
    "     ```python\n",
    "     import pdb\n",
    "     import sys\n",
    "\n",
    "     try:\n",
    "         # Code that may throw an exception\n",
    "         buggy_function(1, '2')\n",
    "     except:\n",
    "         # Start post-mortem debugging\n",
    "         pdb.post_mortem(sys.exc_info()[2])\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Integration with Other Tools**:\n",
    "   - `ipdb`: An enhanced version of `pdb` with IPython integration, providing richer features like syntax highlighting and better introspection.\n",
    "     ```python\n",
    "     import ipdb\n",
    "     ipdb.set_trace()\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Remote Debugging**:\n",
    "   - `pdb-remote`: Allows debugging over a network, which is useful for debugging code running on a remote server or in a containerized environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example Debugging Session\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the following buggy script:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def add(a, b):\n",
    "    result = a + b\n",
    "    return result\n",
    "\n",
    "def buggy_function():\n",
    "    x = 10\n",
    "    y = '20'\n",
    "    z = add(x, y)\n",
    "    print(z)\n",
    "\n",
    "buggy_function()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Set a Breakpoint**:\n",
    "   - Insert `pdb.set_trace()` before the `add` function call:\n",
    "     ```python\n",
    "     def buggy_function():\n",
    "         x = 10\n",
    "         y = '20'\n",
    "         pdb.set_trace()\n",
    "         z = add(x, y)\n",
    "         print(z)\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Run the Script**:\n",
    "   - Execute the script:\n",
    "     ```sh\n",
    "     python myscript.py\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Interact with `pdb`**:\n",
    "   - The debugger will pause execution at `pdb.set_trace()`. You can now use `pdb` commands:\n",
    "     ```sh\n",
    "     (Pdb) l  # List source code around the current line\n",
    "     (Pdb) p x  # Print the value of x\n",
    "     (Pdb) p y  # Print the value of y\n",
    "     (Pdb) n  # Move to the next line\n",
    "     (Pdb) s  # Step into the add function\n",
    "     (Pdb) p a  # Print the value of a\n",
    "     (Pdb) p b  # Print the value of b\n",
    "     (Pdb) q  # Quit the debugger\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "The Python Debugger (`pdb`) is an essential tool for diagnosing and fixing issues in your Python code. It provides a rich set of commands for navigating through your code, inspecting variables, and controlling the execution flow. By mastering `pdb`, you can significantly improve your debugging efficiency and gain deeper insights into the behavior of your programs.\n",

    "### Timing Your Code: `timeit` Module\n",
    "\n",
    "The `timeit` module in Python is a tool used for measuring the execution time of small code snippets. It provides a simple way to time how long it takes to run a piece of code and can help you identify performance bottlenecks. Here are comprehensive notes on using the `timeit` module effectively:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Overview of `timeit` Module\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Purpose**: The `timeit` module is designed to measure the execution time of small code snippets with high precision. It avoids a number of common traps for measuring execution times.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Importing**: You can import the module using:\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  import timeit\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Basic Usage\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Using `timeit.timeit` Method**\n",
    "   - **Syntax**:\n",
    "     ```python\n",
    "     timeit.timeit(stmt='pass', setup='pass', timer=<default timer>, number=1000000, globals=None)\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "   - **Parameters**:\n",
    "     - `stmt`: The code to be timed (default: `'pass'`).\n",
    "     - `setup`: The setup code that runs once before timing (default: `'pass'`).\n",
    "     - `timer`: The timer function to use (default: `time.perf_counter`).\n",

    "     print(results)\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Advanced Usage\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Timing a Function**\n",
    "   - To time a function, define it in the `setup` and call it in the `stmt`:\n",
    "     ```python\n",
    "     import timeit\n",
    "\n",
    "     setup = '''\n",
    "def test():\n",
    "    return sum(range(100))\n",
    "'''\n",
    "\n",
    "     stmt = 'test()'\n",
    "     result = timeit.timeit(stmt, setup=setup, number=100000)\n",
    "     print(result)\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Using `timeit` with Inline Statements**\n",
    "   - You can use the `setup` argument to import modules or define variables needed by the `stmt`:\n",
    "     ```python\n",
    "     import timeit\n",
    "\n",
    "     setup = 'import random'\n",
    "     stmt = 'random.randint(1, 100)'\n",
    "     result = timeit.timeit(stmt, setup=setup, number=100000)\n",
    "     print(result)\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Timing Code in Scripts**\n",
    "   - The `timeit` module can also be used from the command line for quick timing tests:\n",
    "     ```sh\n",
    "     python -m timeit 'sum(range(100))'\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Comparing Different Code Snippets**\n",
    "   - Use the `timeit` module to compare the performance of different implementations:\n",
    "     ```python\n",
    "     import timeit\n",
    "\n",
    "     setup1 = 'numbers = list(range(100))'\n",
    "     stmt1 = 'sum(numbers)'\n",
    "\n",
    "     setup2 = 'numbers = list(range(100))'\n",
    "     stmt2 = 'total = 0\\nfor number in numbers:\\n    total += number'\n",
    "\n",
    "     result1 = timeit.timeit(stmt1, setup=setup1, number=100000)\n",
    "     result2 = timeit.timeit(stmt2, setup=setup2, number=100000)\n",
    "\n",
    "     print(f'Sum using sum(): {result1}')\n",
    "     print(f'Sum using loop: {result2}')\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Tips for Accurate Timing\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Avoid Print Statements**: Avoid using `print` statements in the code being timed, as they can significantly affect the timing results.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Isolate the Code**: Ensure that the code being timed is isolated from other operations that could affect performance, such as I/O operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Warm-Up Runs**: Perform a few warm-up runs before timing to allow any caching mechanisms or just-in-time compilation (JIT) optimizations to take effect.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Use Sufficient Iterations**: Increase the number of iterations (`number` parameter) to get more accurate results, especially for fast-executing code.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Consistent Environment**: Run the timing tests in a consistent environment, ideally with minimal background processes and consistent system load.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Use `repeat` for Stability**: Use `timeit.repeat` to run the timing test multiple times and take the average or median result to account for variability.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example: Timing a Custom Function\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import timeit\n",
    "\n",
    "def custom_function():\n",
    "    return [i * i for i in range(100)]\n",
    "\n",
    "# Timing the custom function\n",
    "setup = '''\n",
    "def custom_function():\n",
    "    return [i * i for i in range(100)]\n",
    "'''\n",
    "\n",
    "stmt = 'custom_function()'\n",
    "result = timeit.timeit(stmt, setup=setup, number=100000)\n",
    "print(result)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Using `timeit` in Jupyter Notebooks\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Magic Commands**: Jupyter notebooks provide `%%timeit` and `%timeit` magic commands for timing code cells and lines, respectively.\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  %%timeit\n",
    "  sum(range(100))\n",

    "Regex flags can be used to modify the behavior of regex patterns:\n",
    "- `re.IGNORECASE` (or `re.I`): Makes the pattern case-insensitive.\n",
    "- `re.MULTILINE` (or `re.M`): Multiline matching, affecting `^` and `$`.\n",
    "- `re.DOTALL` (or `re.S`): Makes `.` match any character, including a newline.\n",
    "- `re.UNICODE` (or `re.U`): Makes `\\w`, `\\W`, `\\b`, `\\B`, `\\d`, `\\D`, `\\s`, and `\\S` dependent on Unicode character properties.\n",
    "- `re.VERBOSE` (or `re.X`): Allows you to write regex patterns that are more readable by allowing you to include whitespace and comments.\n",

    "### StringIO in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Overview\n",
    "`StringIO` is a module in Python that provides a convenient means of working with string data as if it were a file. This is particularly useful when you need file-like operations on string data without the overhead of actual file I/O operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Importing StringIO\n",
    "In Python, `StringIO` is part of the `io` module, which means you need to import it from there:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from io import StringIO\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Basic Usage\n",
    "`StringIO` objects can be used like file objects. You can read from and write to them using standard file methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Creating a StringIO Object**\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   from io import StringIO\n",
    "\n",
    "   # Creating an empty StringIO object\n",
    "   string_io = StringIO()\n",
    "\n",
    "   # Creating a StringIO object with initial data\n",
    "   string_io = StringIO(\"Initial string data\")\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Writing to a StringIO Object**\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   from io import StringIO\n",
    "\n",
    "   string_io = StringIO()\n",
    "   string_io.write(\"Hello, World!\")\n",
    "   string_io.write(\"\\nThis is a test.\")\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Reading from a StringIO Object**\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   from io import StringIO\n",
    "\n",
    "   string_io = StringIO(\"Hello, World!\\nThis is a test.\")\n",
    "   \n",
    "   # Reading all data\n",
    "   data = string_io.read()\n",
    "   \n",
    "   # Reading line by line\n",
    "   string_io.seek(0)  # Reset pointer to the beginning\n",
    "   for line in string_io:\n",
    "       print(line.strip())\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Getting the Value from a StringIO Object**\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   from io import StringIO\n",
    "\n",
    "   string_io = StringIO()\n",
    "   string_io.write(\"Hello, World!\")\n",
    "   string_io.write(\"\\nThis is a test.\")\n",
    "   \n",
    "   # Get the entire contents as a string\n",
    "   contents = string_io.getvalue()\n",
    "   print(contents)\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Closing a StringIO Object**\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   from io import StringIO\n",
    "\n",
    "   string_io = StringIO(\"Some initial text\")\n",
    "   string_io.close()\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Important Methods and Attributes\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`write(string)`**: Writes the string to the StringIO object.\n",
    "- **`read(size=-1)`**: Reads `size` characters from the StringIO object. If `size` is not provided or is negative, reads until EOF.\n",
    "- **`readline(size=-1)`**: Reads one entire line from the StringIO object.\n",
    "- **`readlines(hint=-1)`**: Reads lines from the StringIO object and returns them as a list. `hint` can be used to limit the number of lines returned.\n",
    "- **`getvalue()`**: Returns the entire contents of the StringIO object as a string.\n",
    "- **`seek(offset, whence=0)`**: Changes the stream position to the given byte offset. `whence` can be `0` (default, absolute file positioning), `1` (seek relative to the current position), or `2` (seek relative to the file’s end).\n",
    "- **`tell()`**: Returns the current stream position.\n",
    "- **`close()`**: Closes the StringIO object. After closing, any operation on it will raise a `ValueError`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Practical Examples\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Capturing Print Output**\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   from io import StringIO\n",
    "   import sys\n",
    "\n",
    "   old_stdout = sys.stdout\n",
    "   sys.stdout = string_io = StringIO()\n",
    "\n",
    "   print(\"Capturing this print statement.\")\n",
    "   \n",
    "   sys.stdout = old_stdout\n",
    "   captured_output = string_io.getvalue()\n",
    "   print(\"Captured Output:\", captured_output)\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Simulating File Operations for Testing**\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   from io import StringIO\n",
    "\n",
    "   def process_file(file):\n",
    "       data = file.read()\n",
    "       return data.upper()\n",
    "\n",
    "   test_data = StringIO(\"This is test data.\")\n",
    "   result = process_file(test_data)\n",
    "   print(result)  # Output: THIS IS TEST DATA.\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Reading Configuration from a String**\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   from io import StringIO\n",
    "   import configparser\n",
    "\n",
    "   config_string = \"\"\"\n",
    "   [Section1]\n",
    "   key1 = value1\n",
    "   key2 = value2\n",
    "   \"\"\"\n",
    "\n",
    "   config = configparser.ConfigParser()\n",
    "   config.read_file(StringIO(config_string))\n",
    "   \n",
    "   value1 = config.get('Section1', 'key1')\n",
    "   print(value1)  # Output: value1\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Advantages of StringIO\n",
    "- **Memory Efficiency**: Operations are performed in memory without the need for disk I/O.\n",
    "- **Convenience**: Provides a file-like interface for string manipulation, making it easy to use with code that expects file objects.\n",
    "- **Performance**: Faster than writing to or reading from disk-based files.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Limitations\n",
    "- **Memory Usage**: As the data is stored in memory, it can consume significant memory for large strings.\n",
    "- **Not Persistent**: Data in `StringIO` objects is volatile and is lost once the object is closed or the program exits.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary\n",
    "`StringIO` is a powerful tool in Python for in-memory text stream manipulation, useful for capturing output, testing, and other scenarios where file-like behavior for string data is needed without actual disk I/O. By understanding and utilizing the methods provided by the `StringIO` class, you can perform efficient and effective string operations in a file-like manner.\n",

    "### Advanced Lists in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "Python lists are a fundamental and versatile data structure used to store an ordered collection of items. This guide covers advanced operations and techniques for working with lists in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### List Basics\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Creating Lists**: Use square brackets `[]` or the `list()` constructor.\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  basic_list = [1, 2, 3]\n",
    "  empty_list = []\n",
    "  constructed_list = list((1, 2, 3))\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Accessing Elements**: Use zero-based indexing and slicing.\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  element = basic_list[0]\n",
    "  sublist = basic_list[1:3]\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Modifying Lists**: Lists are mutable, allowing for element assignment.\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  basic_list[1] = 20\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Appending and Extending**: Add elements using `append()` and `extend()`.\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  basic_list.append(4)\n",
    "  basic_list.extend([5, 6])\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Removing Elements**: Use `remove()`, `pop()`, and `del`.\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  basic_list.remove(20)\n",
    "  last_element = basic_list.pop()\n",
    "  del basic_list[0]\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Advanced List Operations\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **List Comprehensions**\n",
    "   - Concise way to create lists.\n",
    "     ```python\n",
    "     squares = [x ** 2 for x in range(10)]\n",
    "     even_squares = [x ** 2 for x in range(10) if x % 2 == 0]\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Nested List Comprehensions**\n",
    "   - For working with multi-dimensional lists.\n",
    "     ```python\n",
    "     matrix = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]]\n",
    "     flat_list = [num for row in matrix for num in row]\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Built-in Functions**\n",
    "   - `len()`: Returns the length of the list.\n",
    "     ```python\n",
    "     length = len(basic_list)\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   - `min()`, `max()`, `sum()`: Return the minimum, maximum, and sum of the list elements.\n",
    "     ```python\n",
    "     minimum = min(basic_list)\n",
    "     maximum = max(basic_list)\n",
    "     total = sum(basic_list)\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   - `sorted()`: Returns a sorted list.\n",
    "     ```python\n",
    "     sorted_list = sorted(basic_list)\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   - `reversed()`: Returns an iterator that accesses the given sequence in reverse order.\n",
    "     ```python\n",
    "     reversed_list = list(reversed(basic_list))\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Copying Lists**\n",
    "   - Use slicing, the `list()` constructor, or the `copy()` method.\n",
    "     ```python\n",
    "     copy1 = basic_list[:]\n",
    "     copy2 = list(basic_list)\n",
    "     copy3 = basic_list.copy()\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Deep Copying**\n",
    "   - Use the `copy` module for nested lists.\n",
    "     ```python\n",
    "     import copy\n",
    "\n",
    "     deep_copy = copy.deepcopy(nested_list)\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **List Slicing**\n",
    "   - Access sublists with slicing.\n",
    "     ```python\n",
    "     sublist = basic_list[1:3]\n",
    "     reversed_sublist = basic_list[::-1]\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **List Methods**\n",
    "   - `index()`: Returns the index of the first occurrence of a value.\n",
    "     ```python\n",
    "     index = basic_list.index(3)\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   - `count()`: Returns the number of occurrences of a value.\n",
    "     ```python\n",
    "     count = basic_list.count(3)\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   - `insert()`: Inserts an element at a specific position.\n",
    "     ```python\n",
    "     basic_list.insert(1, 100)\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   - `clear()`: Removes all elements from the list.\n",
    "     ```python\n",
    "     basic_list.clear()\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **List Iteration**\n",
    "   - Iterate using `for` loops and comprehensions.\n",
    "     ```python\n",
    "     for element in basic_list:\n",
    "         print(element)\n",
    "     \n",
    "     squares = [x ** 2 for x in basic_list]\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "9. **Enumerate**\n",
    "   - Get the index and value during iteration.\n",
    "     ```python\n",
    "     for index, value in enumerate(basic_list):\n",
    "         print(index, value)\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "10. **Zip**\n",
    "    - Combine multiple lists element-wise.\n",
    "      ```python\n",
    "      list1 = [1, 2, 3]\n",
    "      list2 = ['a', 'b', 'c']\n",
    "      combined = list(zip(list1, list2))\n",
    "      ```\n",
    "\n",
    "11. **Unpacking**\n",
    "    - Assign list elements to variables.\n",
