    "**Introduction to Python Data Types**\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is a dynamically typed language, meaning you don't need to declare the type of a variable explicitly. Instead, Python infers the data type based on the value assigned to it. Python supports various data types, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Numeric Types:**\n",
    "   - Integers (`int`): Whole numbers without any decimal point.\n",
    "   - Floats (`float`): Numbers with a decimal point or in exponential form.\n",
    "   - Complex Numbers (`complex`): Numbers with a real and imaginary part represented as `a + bj`, where `a` is the real part, and `b` is the imaginary part.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   x = 10         # integer\n",
    "   y = 3.14       # float\n",
    "   z = 2 + 3j     # complex\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Sequence Types:**\n",
    "   - Strings (`str`): Ordered collection of characters enclosed within single, double, or triple quotes.\n",
    "   - Lists (`list`): Ordered collection of items, mutable (modifiable), and can contain different data types.\n",
    "   - Tuples (`tuple`): Ordered collection of items, immutable (unchangeable), and can contain different data types.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   name = 'John'                 # string\n",
    "   numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]     # list\n",
    "   coordinates = (10, 20)        # tuple\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Mapping Type:**\n",
    "   - Dictionary (`dict`): Unordered collection of key-value pairs, mutable, and keys must be unique and immutable.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   person = {'name': 'John', 'age': 30, 'city': 'New York'}   # dictionary\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Set Types:**\n",
    "   - Set (`set`): Unordered collection of unique items, mutable, and doesn't allow duplicate elements.\n",
    "   - Frozen Set (`frozenset`): Immutable set, once created, elements cannot be changed or added.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   unique_numbers = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}        # set\n",
    "   frozen_numbers = frozenset({1, 2, 3})    # frozenset\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Boolean Type:**\n",
    "   - Boolean (`bool`): Represents truth values `True` or `False`.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   is_active = True         # boolean\n",
    "   is_valid = False         # boolean\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **None Type:**\n",
    "   - None (`NoneType`): Represents the absence of a value or a null value.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   result = None            # None type\n",
    "   ```\n",

    "**Variable Assignments in Python**\n",
    "\n",
    "Variables are used to store data values in a program. In Python, variable assignment is straightforward and does not require declaring the data type explicitly. Here are the key aspects of variable assignments:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Variable Naming Rules:**\n",
    "   - Variable names can contain letters (a-z, A-Z), digits (0-9), and underscores (_).\n",
    "   - They must begin with a letter or an underscore but cannot begin with a digit.\n",
    "   - Variable names are case-sensitive (`myVar` is different from `myvar`).\n",
    "   - Python keywords cannot be used as variable names.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Assignment Operator (`=`):**\n",
    "   - The assignment operator (`=`) is used to assign a value to a variable.\n",
    "   - The value on the right side of the operator is assigned to the variable on the left side.\n",
    "   - Example: `x = 10`, `name = 'John'`.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Dynamic Typing:**\n",
    "   - Python is dynamically typed, meaning you don't need to specify the data type of a variable.\n",
    "   - The interpreter automatically determines the data type based on the assigned value.\n",
    "   - Example: `x = 10` (integer), `name = 'John'` (string).\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Multiple Assignments:**\n",
    "   - Python allows assigning multiple variables in a single line.\n",
    "   - Values are assigned from left to right.\n",
    "   - Example: `x, y, z = 10, 20, 30`.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Reassigning Variables:**\n",
    "   - Variables can be reassigned with new values as needed.\n",
    "   - The new value replaces the old value stored in the variable.\n",
    "   - Example: `x = 10`, `x = 20` (reassigning `x` with a new value).\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Swapping Variables:**\n",
    "   - Python allows swapping the values of two variables in a single line.\n",
    "   - Example: `x, y = y, x` (swaps the values of `x` and `y`).\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Deleting Variables:**\n",
    "   - The `del` keyword is used to delete a variable and free up the memory space it occupies.\n",
    "   - Example: `del x` (deletes variable `x`).\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **Variable Scope:**\n",
    "   - Variables have a scope, which defines where they can be accessed or referenced in a program.\n",
    "   - Variables defined inside a function have local scope and are accessible only within that function.\n",
    "   - Variables defined outside any function have global scope and can be accessed throughout the program.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. **Constants:**\n",
    "   - Although Python does not have built-in constant types, variables can be treated as constants by convention.\n",
    "   - Constants are typically named using uppercase letters to differentiate them from regular variables.\n",
    "   - Example: `PI = 3.14159`, `MAX_VALUE = 100`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding variable assignments is fundamental to programming in Python, as variables serve as placeholders for storing and manipulating data throughout the program. Proper naming conventions and understanding variable scope help ensure code readability and maintainability.\n",

    "**Introduction to Strings in Python**\n",
    "\n",
    "Strings are used to represent textual data in Python. They are a sequence of characters enclosed within single (''), double (\"\") or triple (''''' or \"\"\") quotes. Strings are immutable, meaning once created, they cannot be modified.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Creating Strings:**\n",
    "   - Single Quotes: `'Hello'`, `'Python'`\n",
    "   - Double Quotes: `\"World\"`, `\"Programming\"`\n",
    "   - Triple Quotes: `'''Triple quotes'''`, `\"\"\"for multi-line strings\"\"\"`\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Accessing Characters:**\n",
    "   - Individual characters in a string can be accessed using indexing.\n",
    "   - Indexing starts from 0 for the first character.\n",
    "   - Negative indexing starts from -1 for the last character.\n",
    "   - Example:\n",
    "     ```python\n",
    "     my_string = \"Hello\"\n",
    "     first_char = my_string[0]       # 'H'\n",

    "\n",
    "3. **String Slicing:**\n",
    "   - String slicing is used to extract a substring from a string.\n",
    "   - Syntax: `string[start:stop:step]`\n",
    "   - `start`: Starting index (inclusive), default is 0.\n",
    "   - `stop`: Ending index (exclusive), default is the length of the string.\n",
    "   - `step`: Step size for slicing, default is 1.\n",
    "   - Example:\n",
    "     ```python\n",
    "     my_string = \"Hello World\"\n",
    "     substring = my_string[0:5]      # 'Hello'\n",
    "     ```\n",

    "   - Python provides numerous built-in methods to manipulate strings.\n",
    "   - `len()`: Returns the length of the string.\n",
    "   - `lower()`, `upper()`: Converts the string to lowercase or uppercase.\n",
    "   - `strip()`, `lstrip()`, `rstrip()`: Removes whitespace characters from the beginning, end, or both ends of the string.\n",
    "   - `split()`: Splits the string into a list of substrings based on a delimiter.\n",
    "   - `join()`: Joins the elements of a list into a single string using a specified separator.\n",
    "   - `find()`, `index()`: Searches for a substring within the string and returns its index.\n",
    "   - `replace()`: Replaces occurrences of a substring with another substring.\n",
    "   - Example:\n",
    "     ```python\n",
    "     my_string = \"   Hello, World!   \"\n",
    "     length = len(my_string)               # 17\n",
    "     stripped_string = my_string.strip()   # 'Hello, World!'\n",
    "     words = my_string.split(',')          # ['   Hello', ' World!   ']\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **String Formatting:**\n",
    "   - String formatting allows for dynamic insertion of values into strings.\n",
    "   - Various methods are available, including:\n",
    "     - Using `%` operator.\n",
    "     - Using `str.format()` method.\n",
    "     - Using f-strings (formatted string literals).\n",

    "\n",
    "Strings in Python are sequences of characters, and indexing and slicing are techniques used to access and manipulate substrings within a string.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Indexing:**\n",
    "   - Indexing is the process of accessing individual characters in a string.\n",
    "   - Each character in a string has a unique index position, starting from 0.\n",
    "   - Positive indexing starts from the beginning of the string (left to right).\n",
    "   - Negative indexing starts from the end of the string (right to left), with -1 representing the last character.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Example:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   my_string = \"Hello\"\n",
    "   first_char = my_string[0]     # 'H'\n",

    "   substring = my_string[0:5]      # 'Hello'\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Default Values:**\n",
    "   - If `start` is not provided, slicing starts from the beginning of the string.\n",
    "   - If `stop` is not provided, slicing continues until the end of the string.\n",
    "   - If `step` is not provided, every character is included in the slice.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Example:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   my_string = \"Hello World\"\n",
    "   substring_1 = my_string[:5]       # 'Hello'\n",

    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Negative Indexing and Slicing:**\n",
    "   - Negative indices can be used to slice the string from the end.\n",
    "   - Negative step size can be used to reverse the string.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Example:\n",

    "   reverse_string = my_string[::-1]      # 'dlroW olleH'\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Slice Assignment:**\n",
    "   - Slicing can be used for assignment to modify parts of a string.\n",
    "   - The assigned value must be of the same data type (string).\n",
    "\n",
    "   Example:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   my_string = \"Hello World\"\n",
    "   my_string = my_string[:5] + \"Python\"   # 'HelloPython'\n",

There are several ways to achieve print formatting, including string concatenation, using the `%` operator, and using f-strings (formatted string literals).\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **String Concatenation:**\n",
    "   - String concatenation involves joining multiple strings together using the `+` operator.\n",
    "   - Strings and variables can be concatenated to form a single string.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Example:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   name = \"John\"\n",
    "   age = 30\n",
    "   print(\"My name is \" + name + \" and I am \" + str(age) + \" years old.\")\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Using the `%` Operator (Old Style Formatting):**\n",
    "   - The `%` operator is used to format strings by inserting values into placeholders.\n",
    "   - Placeholders are represented by `%` followed by a format specifier.\n",
    "   - Format specifiers include `%s` for strings, `%d` for integers, `%f` for floating-point numbers, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Example:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   name = \"John\"\n",
    "   age = 30\n",
    "   print(\"My name is %s and I am %d years old.\" % (name, age))\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Using `str.format()` Method (New Style Formatting):**\n",
    "   - The `str.format()` method provides more flexibility and readability for string formatting.\n",
    "   - Placeholders are represented by curly braces `{}` and can include optional format specifiers.\n",
    "   - Values are passed as arguments to the `format()` method.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Example:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   name = \"John\"\n",
    "   age = 30\n",
    "   print(\"My name is {} and I am {} years old.\".format(name, age))\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Using f-Strings (Formatted String Literals):**\n",
    "   - Introduced in Python 3.6, f-strings provide a concise and intuitive way to format strings.\n",
    "   - Variables and expressions can be directly embedded within the string using curly braces `{}` preceded by an `f` or `F`.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Example:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   name = \"John\"\n",
    "   age = 30\n",
    "   print(f\"My name is {name} and I am {age} years old.\")\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Format Specifiers:**\n",
    "   - Format specifiers can be used to control the appearance of values in the formatted string.\n",
    "   - They include options for specifying width, precision, alignment, and type.\n",
    "   - Example: `%10s` (right-aligned string with width 10), `%.2f` (floating-point number with 2 decimal places).\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Escape Characters in Formatted Strings:**\n",
    "   - Escape characters such as `\\n` (newline) and `\\t` (tab) can be used within formatted strings to control formatting.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Example:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   name = \"John\"\n",
    "   age = 30\n",
    "   print(f\"My name is {name}\\nand I am {age} years old.\")\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",

    "**Float Formatting in Python**\n",
    "\n",
    "Float formatting refers to the process of formatting floating-point numbers for display, controlling aspects such as precision, width, alignment, and notation (fixed-point or scientific).\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Syntax:**\n",
    "   - Float formatting can be achieved using various methods, including old-style formatting with the `%` operator, the `str.format()` method, and f-strings (formatted string literals).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Old-Style Formatting with `%` Operator:**\n",
    "   - The `%` operator is used to format floating-point numbers by specifying format specifiers.\n",
    "   - The format specifier `%f` is used for floating-point numbers.\n",
    "   - Additional options such as width, precision, and alignment can be specified using the format specifier syntax `%[width].[precision]f`.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Example:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   num = 3.14159\n",
    "   print(\"Formatted number: %.2f\" % num)   # Displays: Formatted number: 3.14\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Using `str.format()` Method:**\n",
    "   - The `str.format()` method provides more flexibility for float formatting by allowing the specification of format options within curly braces `{}`.\n",
    "   - The format specifier syntax `{:[width].[precision]f}` is used to specify the desired width and precision.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Example:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   num = 3.14159\n",
    "   print(\"Formatted number: {:.2f}\".format(num))   # Displays: Formatted number: 3.14\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Using f-Strings (Formatted String Literals):**\n",
    "   - f-Strings (introduced in Python 3.6) offer a concise and readable way to format floating-point numbers.\n",
    "   - Float formatting with f-strings follows the syntax `{variable_name:[width].[precision]f}`.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Example:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   num = 3.14159\n",
    "   print(f\"Formatted number: {num:.2f}\")   # Displays: Formatted number: 3.14\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Width and Precision:**\n",
    "   - Width specifies the minimum number of characters to be used for displaying the number. If the formatted number is shorter than the specified width, it is padded with spaces by default.\n",
    "   - Precision specifies the number of decimal places to be displayed after the decimal point.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Example:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   num = 123.456\n",
    "   print(\"Formatted number: {:10.2f}\".format(num))   # Displays: Formatted number:     123.46\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Alignment:**\n",
    "   - By default, float values are right-aligned within the specified width.\n",
    "   - To specify left alignment, a negative sign (`-`) can be added before the width specifier.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Example:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   num = 123.456\n",
    "   print(\"Formatted number: {:<10.2f}\".format(num))   # Displays: Formatted number: 123.46\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Scientific Notation:**\n",
    "   - Float values can be displayed in scientific notation using the format specifier `%e` (old-style formatting) or `{:.2e}` (new-style formatting).\n",
    "\n",
    "   Example:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   num = 12345.6789\n",
    "   print(\"Scientific notation: %.2e\" % num)   # Displays: Scientific notation: 1.23e+04\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",

    "**Lists in Python**\n",
    "\n",
    "Lists are one of the most versatile and commonly used data structures in Python. They are ordered collections of items, where each item can be of any data type, including other lists. Lists are mutable, meaning they can be modified after creation.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Creating Lists:**\n",
    "   - Lists are created by enclosing comma-separated items within square brackets `[]`.\n",
    "   - Items within a list can be of different data types, and lists can contain other lists (nested lists).\n",
    "\n",
    "   Example:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n",
    "   mixed_list = ['apple', 3.14, True, [1, 2, 3]]\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Accessing Elements:**\n",
    "   - Elements in a list are accessed using indexing.\n",
    "   - Indexing starts from 0 for the first element and can be both positive and negative.\n",
    "   - Negative indexing starts from -1 for the last element.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Example:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   my_list = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry', 'date']\n",
    "   first_element = my_list[0]       # 'apple'\n",
    "   last_element = my_list[-1]       # 'date'\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Slicing Lists:**\n",
    "   - List slicing is used to extract a sublist (slice) from a list.\n",
    "   - Syntax: `list[start:stop:step]`.\n",
    "   - `start`: Starting index (inclusive), default is 0.\n",
    "   - `stop`: Ending index (exclusive), default is the length of the list.\n",
    "   - `step`: Step size for slicing, default is 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Example:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   my_list = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry', 'date']\n",
    "   sliced_list = my_list[1:3]      # ['banana', 'cherry']\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Modifying Lists:**\n",
    "   - Lists can be modified by adding, removing, or updating elements.\n",
    "   - Common methods for modifying lists include `append()`, `insert()`, `extend()`, `remove()`, `pop()`, `clear()`, and assignment.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Example:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   my_list = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']\n",
    "   my_list.append('date')        # ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry', 'date']\n",
    "   my_list[1] = 'orange'         # ['apple', 'orange', 'cherry', 'date']\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **List Operations:**\n",
    "   - Concatenation (`+`): Combines two lists into a single list.\n",
    "   - Repetition (`*`): Repeats the elements of a list a specified number of times.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Example:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   list1 = [1, 2, 3]\n",
    "   list2 = [4, 5, 6]\n",
    "   combined_list = list1 + list2      # [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **List Comprehensions:**\n",
    "   - List comprehensions provide a concise way to create lists based on existing lists.\n",
    "   - They consist of an expression followed by a `for` clause, optionally followed by additional `for` or `if` clauses.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Example:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n",
    "   squared_numbers = [x**2 for x in numbers]      # [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Built-in Functions:**\n",
    "   - Python provides several built-in functions for working with lists, including `len()`, `max()`, `min()`, `sum()`, `sorted()`, and `reversed()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Example:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   numbers = [5, 2, 8, 3, 1]\n",
    "   length = len(numbers)            # 5\n",
    "   maximum = max(numbers)           # 8\n",

    "**Dictionaries in Python**\n",
    "\n",
    "Dictionaries are unordered collections of key-value pairs. They are used to store data in the form of mappings, where each key is associated with a value. Dictionaries are mutable, meaning they can be modified after creation. Keys within a dictionary must be unique and immutable (e.g., strings, numbers, tuples), while values can be of any data type.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Creating Dictionaries:**\n",
    "   - Dictionaries are created by enclosing comma-separated key-value pairs within curly braces `{}`.\n",
    "   - Key-value pairs are separated by colons `:`.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Example:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   my_dict = {'name': 'John', 'age': 30, 'city': 'New York'}\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Accessing Elements:**\n",
    "   - Elements in a dictionary are accessed using keys rather than indices.\n",
    "   - Key-based access allows for efficient retrieval of values based on their associated keys.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Example:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   my_dict = {'name': 'John', 'age': 30, 'city': 'New York'}\n",
    "   name = my_dict['name']     # 'John'\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Modifying Dictionaries:**\n",
    "   - Dictionaries can be modified by adding, removing, or updating key-value pairs.\n",
    "   - Common methods for modifying dictionaries include `update()`, `pop()`, `popitem()`, `clear()`, and assignment.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Example:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   my_dict = {'name': 'John', 'age': 30}\n",
    "   my_dict['city'] = 'New York'    # {'name': 'John', 'age': 30, 'city': 'New York'}\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Dictionary Operations:**\n",
    "   - Concatenation and repetition operations are not applicable to dictionaries.\n",
    "   - However, dictionary comprehension can be used to create new dictionaries based on existing ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Example:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   dict1 = {'a': 1, 'b': 2}\n",
    "   dict2 = {'c': 3, 'd': 4}\n",

    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Dictionary Methods:**\n",
    "   - Python provides numerous built-in methods for working with dictionaries, including `keys()`, `values()`, `items()`, `get()`, `setdefault()`, `update()`, `pop()`, `popitem()`, `clear()`, and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Example:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   my_dict = {'name': 'John', 'age': 30, 'city': 'New York'}\n",
    "   keys = my_dict.keys()           # dict_keys(['name', 'age', 'city'])\n",
    "   values = my_dict.values()       # dict_values(['John', 30, 'New York'])\n",
    "   items = my_dict.items()         # dict_items([('name', 'John'), ('age', 30), ('city', 'New York')])\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Nested Dictionaries:**\n",
    "   - Dictionaries can contain other dictionaries as values, allowing for hierarchical data structures.\n",
    "   - Nested dictionaries are useful for representing complex data relationships.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Example:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   person = {\n",
    "       'name': 'John',\n",
    "       'age': 30,\n",
    "       'address': {\n",

    "\n",
    "Tuples are ordered collections of elements, similar to lists, but with one key difference: tuples are immutable, meaning they cannot be modified after creation. Tuples are commonly used for storing related data that should not be changed, such as coordinates, database records, and function return values.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Creating Tuples:**\n",
    "   - Tuples are created by enclosing comma-separated elements within parentheses `()`.\n",
    "   - Elements within a tuple can be of any data type, and tuples can contain heterogeneous data types (e.g., integers, strings, floats).\n",
    "\n",
    "   Example:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   my_tuple = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)\n",
    "   mixed_tuple = ('apple', 3.14, True)\n",

    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Slicing Tuples:**\n",
    "   - Tuple slicing is used to extract a sub-tuple (slice) from a tuple.\n",

    "\n",
    "5. **Tuple Methods:**\n",
    "   - Tuples are immutable, so they have fewer built-in methods compared to lists.\n",
    "   - Common methods include `count()` for counting occurrences of an element and `index()` for finding the index of an element.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Example:\n",

    "\n",
    "6. **Tuple Packing and Unpacking:**\n",
    "   - Tuple packing refers to the process of packing multiple values into a single tuple.\n",
    "   - Tuple unpacking involves assigning the elements of a tuple to multiple variables in a single assignment statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Example:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   packed_tuple = 1, 2, 3               # Tuple packing\n",
    "   x, y, z = packed_tuple               # Tuple unpacking\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Immutable Nature:**\n",
    "   - Tuples are immutable, meaning once created, their elements cannot be changed, added, or removed.\n",

    "   ```python\n",
    "   my_tuple = (1, 2, 3)\n",
    "   # Attempting to modify a tuple will raise an error\n",
    "   # my_tuple[0] = 4   # Raises TypeError: 'tuple' object does not support item assignment\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "Tuples are useful data structures in Python for representing fixed collections of items that should not be modified.

    "Tuples are immutable data structures in Python, meaning they cannot be modified after creation. As a result, tuples have fewer built-in methods compared to lists. However, there are still some useful methods available for working with tuples.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **`count(value)` Method:**\n",
    "   - The `count()` method returns the number of occurrences of a specified value in the tuple.\n",
    "   - Syntax: `tuple.count(value)`.\n",
    "   - The method takes one argument, `value`, which is the value to be counted.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Example:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   my_tuple = (1, 2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 1)\n",
    "   count_ones = my_tuple.count(1)      # 3\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **`index(value)` Method:**\n",
    "   - The `index()` method returns the index of the first occurrence of a specified value in the tuple.\n",
    "   - Syntax: `tuple.index(value)`.\n",
    "   - The method takes one argument, `value`, which is the value to be searched for.\n",
    "   - If the value is not found in the tuple, a `ValueError` is raised.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Example:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   my_tuple = ('a', 'b', 'c', 'a', 'b')\n",
    "   index_b = my_tuple.index('b')        # 1\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Tuple Packing and Unpacking:**\n",
    "   - Tuple packing refers to the process of packing multiple values into a single tuple.\n",
    "   - Tuple unpacking involves assigning the elements of a tuple to multiple variables in a single assignment statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Example:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   packed_tuple = 1, 2, 3               # Tuple packing\n",
    "   x, y, z = packed_tuple               # Tuple unpacking\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Immutable Nature:**\n",
    "   - Tuples are immutable, meaning once created, their elements cannot be changed, added, or removed.\n",
    "   - However, tuples themselves can be reassigned.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Example:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   my_tuple = (1, 2, 3)\n",
    "   # Attempting to modify a tuple will raise an error\n",
    "   # my_tuple[0] = 4   # Raises TypeError: 'tuple' object does not support item assignment\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "Tuple methods are limited due to the immutable nature of tuples. However, the `count()` and `index()` methods provide useful functionality for counting occurrences and finding the index of specific values within tuples. Understanding these methods is essential for effective manipulation and analysis of tuples in Python. Additionally, understanding tuple packing and unpacking is important for working with tuples in various contexts, such as function return values and multiple variable assignments.\n",

    "**Sets in Python**\n",
    "\n",
    "Sets are unordered collections of unique elements. They are mutable, meaning they can be modified after creation. Sets are useful for tasks such as removing duplicates from a list, testing membership, and performing mathematical operations such as union, intersection, and difference.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Creating Sets:**\n",
    "   - Sets are created by enclosing comma-separated elements within curly braces `{}`.\n",
    "   - Alternatively, the `set()` constructor can be used to create an empty set or convert other iterable objects (such as lists or tuples) to sets.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Example:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   my_set = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}\n",
    "   empty_set = set()\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Adding Elements:**\n",
    "   - Elements can be added to a set using the `add()` method.\n",
    "   - If the element already exists in the set, it will not be added again.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Example:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   my_set = {1, 2, 3}\n",
    "   my_set.add(4)\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Removing Elements:**\n",
    "   - Elements can be removed from a set using the `remove()` or `discard()` methods.\n",
    "   - If the element does not exist in the set, `remove()` will raise a `KeyError`, while `discard()` will not raise an error.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Example:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   my_set = {1, 2, 3}\n",
    "   my_set.remove(2)\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Set Operations:**\n",
    "   - Union (`|`): Combines elements from two sets, excluding duplicates.\n",
    "   - Intersection (`&`): Returns elements common to both sets.\n",
    "   - Difference (`-`): Returns elements present in the first set but not in the second set.\n",
    "   - Symmetric Difference (`^`): Returns elements present in either set, but not in both sets.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Example:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   set1 = {1, 2, 3}\n",
    "   set2 = {3, 4, 5}\n",
    "   union_set = set1 | set2         # {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}\n",
    "   intersection_set = set1 & set2  # {3}\n",
    "   difference_set = set1 - set2    # {1, 2}\n",
    "   symmetric_difference_set = set1 ^ set2  # {1, 2, 4, 5}\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Set Methods:**\n",
    "   - Python provides various built-in methods for working with sets, including `add()`, `remove()`, `discard()`, `clear()`, `pop()`, `copy()`, `update()`, `intersection()`, `union()`, `difference()`, `symmetric_difference()`, `issubset()`, `issuperset()`, and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Example:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   my_set = {1, 2, 3}\n",
    "   my_set.update({4, 5, 6})      # {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Immutable Elements:**\n",
    "   - Sets can only contain immutable elements, such as numbers, strings, and tuples.\n",
    "   - Mutable objects like lists cannot be elements of a set.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Example:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   my_set = {1, 'hello', (1, 2, 3)}\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "Sets are useful data structures in Python for storing unique elements and performing set operations efficiently. Understanding set operations, methods, and their immutable nature is essential for effective use of sets in Python programming. Sets are particularly handy for tasks requiring unique element storage and set manipulation operations.\n",

    "**Boolean in Python**\n",
    "\n",
    "Boolean is a built-in data type in Python used to represent truth values. A Boolean value can either be `True` or `False`. Boolean values are commonly used in conditional statements, loops, and logical operations to control program flow and make decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Creating Boolean Values:**\n",
    "   - Boolean values are created using the keywords `True` and `False`.\n",
    "   - These keywords are case-sensitive and must be written in lowercase.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Example:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   x = True\n",
    "   y = False\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Boolean Operations:**\n",
    "   - Python supports several operators for performing Boolean operations, including logical AND (`and`), logical OR (`or`), and logical NOT (`not`).\n",
    "   - The `and` operator returns `True` if both operands are `True`, otherwise, it returns `False`.\n",
    "   - The `or` operator returns `True` if at least one of the operands is `True`, otherwise, it returns `False`.\n",
    "   - The `not` operator returns the opposite Boolean value of the operand.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Example:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   a = True\n",
    "   b = False\n",
    "   result_and = a and b   # False\n",
    "   result_or = a or b     # True\n",
    "   result_not = not a     # False\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Comparison Operators:**\n",
    "   - Comparison operators such as equal to (`==`), not equal to (`!=`), greater than (`>`), less than (`<`), greater than or equal to (`>=`), and less than or equal to (`<=`) return Boolean values based on the comparison of two operands.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Example:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   x = 5\n",
    "   y = 10\n",
    "   result_equal = x == y       # False\n",
    "   result_greater_than = x > y # False\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Boolean Conversion:**\n",
    "   - Values of other data types can be converted to Boolean using the `bool()` constructor.\n",
    "   - All values in Python have an associated Boolean value. In general, empty sequences (such as empty strings, lists, and tuples) are considered `False`, while non-empty sequences are considered `True`. Similarly, numeric zero values are considered `False`, while non-zero values are considered `True`.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Example:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   x = 0\n",
    "   y = [1, 2, 3]\n",
    "   result_x = bool(x)   # False\n",
    "   result_y = bool(y)   # True\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Boolean in Conditional Statements:**\n",
    "   - Boolean values are commonly used in conditional statements (`if`, `elif`, `else`) to execute specific blocks of code based on whether a condition evaluates to `True` or `False`.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Example:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   x = 5\n",
    "   if x > 0:\n",
    "       print(\"x is positive\")\n",
    "   else:\n",
    "       print(\"x is non-positive\")\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Boolean in Loops:**\n",
    "   - Boolean values are often used as loop conditions to iterate until a certain condition is met.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Example:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   while condition:\n",
    "       # Loop body\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",

    "**I/O with Basic Files in Python**\n",
    "\n",
    "File I/O operations in Python allow you to read from and write to files. This is essential for data storage, data analysis, configuration management, and many other tasks. Python provides built-in functions and methods for handling files in a straightforward manner.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Opening Files\n",
    "\n",
    "To work with files, the first step is to open them using the `open()` function. This function returns a file object and is used with two main parameters: the file name and the mode.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Syntax:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "file_object = open(filename, mode)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Modes:**\n",
    "- `'r'`: Read (default mode). Opens a file for reading, error if the file does not exist.\n",
    "- `'w'`: Write. Opens a file for writing, creates the file if it does not exist, truncates the file if it exists.\n",
    "- `'a'`: Append. Opens a file for appending, creates the file if it does not exist.\n",
    "- `'b'`: Binary mode. Used for binary files (e.g., images).\n",
    "- `'t'`: Text mode (default). Used for text files.\n",
    "- `'x'`: Exclusive creation. Creates a new file, returns an error if the file exists.\n",
    "- `'+'`: Update mode. Allows reading and writing (e.g., `'r+'` for reading and writing).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Examples:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Open a file for reading\n",
    "file = open('example.txt', 'r')\n",
    "\n",
    "# Open a file for writing (and create if it doesn't exist)\n",
    "file = open('example.txt', 'w')\n",
    "\n",
    "# Open a file for appending\n",
    "file = open('example.txt', 'a')\n",
    "\n",
    "# Open a binary file for reading\n",
    "file = open('example.jpg', 'rb')\n",
    "\n",
    "# Open a text file for updating (reading and writing)\n",
    "file = open('example.txt', 'r+')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Reading from Files\n",
    "\n",
    "Python provides several methods to read from files:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `read()`: Reads the entire file.\n",
    "- `read(size)`: Reads up to `size` characters/bytes.\n",
    "- `readline()`: Reads a single line from the file.\n",
    "- `readlines()`: Reads all the lines in a file and returns them as a list.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Examples:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "file = open('example.txt', 'r')\n",
    "\n",
    "# Read the entire file\n",
    "content = file.read()\n",
    "\n",
    "# Read the first 10 characters\n",
    "content = file.read(10)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Read one line at a time\n",
    "line = file.readline()\n",
    "\n",
    "# Read all lines into a list\n",
    "lines = file.readlines()\n",
    "\n",
    "# Always close the file after reading\n",
    "file.close()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Writing to Files\n",
    "\n",
    "To write to a file, you can use the following methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `write(string)`: Writes a string to the file.\n",
    "- `writelines(list_of_strings)`: Writes a list of strings to the file.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Examples:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "file = open('example.txt', 'w')\n",
    "\n",
    "# Write a single string\n",
    "file.write('Hello, World!')\n",
    "\n",
    "# Write multiple lines\n",
    "lines = ['First line\\n', 'Second line\\n', 'Third line\\n']\n",
    "file.writelines(lines)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Always close the file after writing\n",
    "file.close()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Appending to Files\n",
    "\n",
    "Appending to a file means adding new content at the end of the existing content without truncating it.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Examples:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "file = open('example.txt', 'a')\n",
    "\n",
    "# Append a single string\n",
    "file.write('Appending a new line.\\n')\n",
    "\n",
    "# Append multiple lines\n",
    "more_lines = ['Fourth line\\n', 'Fifth line\\n']\n",
    "file.writelines(more_lines)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Always close the file after appending\n",
    "file.close()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Closing Files\n",
    "\n",
    "It’s important to close files after you’re done with them to free up system resources. This can be done using the `close()` method.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Examples:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "file = open('example.txt', 'r')\n",
    "content = file.read()\n",
    "file.close()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. Using `with` Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the `with` statement is the preferred way to handle file I/O in Python as it ensures proper resource management. It automatically closes the file when the block inside the `with` statement is exited.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Examples:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Read from a file\n",
    "with open('example.txt', 'r') as file:\n",
    "    content = file.read()\n",
    "\n",
    "# Write to a file\n",
    "with open('example.txt', 'w') as file:\n",
    "    file.write('Hello, World!')\n",
    "\n",
    "# Append to a file\n",
    "with open('example.txt', 'a') as file:\n",
    "    file.write('Appending a new line.\\n')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7. File Object Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some additional useful methods available for file objects:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `file.tell()`: Returns the current file position.\n",
    "- `file.seek(offset, whence)`: Changes the file position to `offset` bytes, `whence` can be 0 (beginning), 1 (current position), or 2 (end of file).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Examples:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "with open('example.txt', 'r') as file:\n",
    "    # Move to the 10th byte in the file\n",
    "    file.seek(10)\n",
    "    # Read from the 10th byte\n",
    "    content = file.read()\n",
    "\n",
    "    # Get the current file position\n",
    "    position = file.tell()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 8. Handling File Exceptions\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with files, it's important to handle potential exceptions, such as when a file does not exist or cannot be opened.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Examples:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    with open('non_existent_file.txt', 'r') as file:\n",
    "        content = file.read()\n",
    "except FileNotFoundError:\n",
    "    print('File not found.')\n",
    "except IOError:\n",
    "    print('An I/O error occurred.')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "File I/O in Python is essential for reading from and writing to files. Key concepts include:\n",
    "- Opening files using `open()`\n",
    "- Reading from files with `read()`, `readline()`, and `readlines()`\n",

    "\n",
    "Comparison operators can be used with different data types, including numbers, strings, and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "**With Numbers:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "a = 10\n",
    "b = 20\n",
    "\n",
    "# Equal\n",
    "print(a == b)  # False\n",

    "### Conditional Statements in Python: `if`, `elif`, and `else`\n",
    "\n",
    "Conditional statements in Python allow you to execute certain blocks of code based on specific conditions. The `if`, `elif`, and `else` statements form the core of decision-making in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. The `if` Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "The `if` statement allows you to execute a block of code if a specified condition is `True`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Syntax:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "if condition:\n",
    "    # block of code to be executed if the condition is true\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "x = 10\n",
    "\n",
    "if x > 5:\n",
    "    print(\"x is greater than 5\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. The `elif` Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "The `elif` (short for else if) statement allows you to check multiple expressions for `True` and execute a block of code as soon as one of the conditions is `True`. It is used after an `if` statement and before an `else` statement (if present).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Syntax:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "if condition1:\n",
    "    # block of code to be executed if condition1 is true\n",
    "elif condition2:\n",
    "    # block of code to be executed if the condition1 is false and condition2 is true\n",
    "```\n",

    "if x > 15:\n",
    "    print(\"x is greater than 15\")\n",
    "elif x > 5:\n",
    "    print(\"x is greater than 5 but less than or equal to 15\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. The `else` Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "The `else` statement allows you to execute a block of code if none of the preceding conditions are `True`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Syntax:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "if condition1:\n",
    "    # block of code to be executed if condition1 is true\n",
    "elif condition2:\n",
    "    # block of code to be executed if the condition1 is false and condition2 is true\n",
    "else:\n",
    "    # block of code to be executed if none of the above conditions are true\n",

    "else:\n",
    "    print(\"x is less than 5\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Nested `if` Statements\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use one `if`, `elif`, or `else` statement inside another `if`, `elif`, or `else` statement. This is called nesting.\n",

    "else:\n",
    "    print(\"x is not greater than 5\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Multiple Conditions\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use logical operators (`and`, `or`, `not`) to combine multiple conditions in an `if`, `elif`, or `else` statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "x = 10\n",

    "    print(\"x is not greater than 15\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Inline `if` Statements\n",
    "\n",
    "For simple conditions, you can use a one-line `if` statement, also known as a ternary operator.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Syntax:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "value_if_true if condition else value_if_false\n",

    "### Practical Usage\n",
    "\n",
    "Conditional statements are used in many scenarios such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Decision Making:**\n",
    "   - Execute different blocks of code based on user input.\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   age = int(input(\"Enter your age: \"))\n",
    "   if age >= 18:\n",

    "   for i in range(10):\n",
    "       if i % 2 == 0:\n",
    "           print(f\"{i} is even\")\n",

    "           print(f\"{i} is odd\")\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Function Control:**\n",
    "   - Determine the behavior of functions based on parameters.\n",

    "### For Loops in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "A `for` loop in Python is used to iterate over a sequence (such as a list, tuple, dictionary, set, or string) and execute a block of code for each element in the sequence. `For` loops are fundamental for performing repetitive tasks and processing items in collections.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Basic Syntax\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic syntax of a `for` loop is:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "for variable in sequence:\n",
    "    # Code block to execute\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, `variable` is the loop variable that takes the value of the current element in the sequence during each iteration, and `sequence` is the collection of items to iterate over.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Iterating over a list\n",
    "numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n",
    "for number in numbers:\n",
    "    print(number)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Iterating Over Different Sequences\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use `for` loops to iterate over different types of sequences:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **List:**\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  fruits = [\"apple\", \"banana\", \"cherry\"]\n",
    "  for fruit in fruits:\n",
    "      print(fruit)\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **String:**\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  for char in \"Hello\":\n",
    "      print(char)\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Tuple:**\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  coordinates = (10, 20, 30)\n",
    "  for coord in coordinates:\n",
    "      print(coord)\n",

    "  for name in ages:\n",
    "      print(name, ages[name])\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. The `range()` Function\n",
    "\n",
    "The `range()` function is commonly used with `for` loops to generate a sequence of numbers. It can take up to three arguments: `start`, `stop`, and `step`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Syntax:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "range(stop)\n",
    "range(start, stop)\n",
    "range(start, stop, step)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Examples:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Iterating from 0 to 4\n",
    "for i in range(5):\n",
    "    print(i)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Iterating from 2 to 5\n",

    "    print(i)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Iterating from 1 to 9 with a step of 2\n",
    "for i in range(1, 10, 2):\n",
    "    print(i)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Nested `for` Loops\n",
    "\n",
    "You can nest `for` loops inside other `for` loops to iterate over multi-dimensional sequences.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "matrix = [\n",
    "    [1, 2, 3],\n",
    "    [4, 5, 6],\n",
    "    [7, 8, 9]\n",

    "    for element in row:\n",
    "        print(element, end=\" \")\n",
    "    print()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Using `else` with `for` Loops\n",
    "\n",
    "An optional `else` block can be used with a `for` loop. The code inside the `else` block is executed after the loop completes normally (i.e., without encountering a `break` statement).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "for i in range(5):\n",
    "    print(i)\n",
    "else:\n",
    "    print(\"Loop completed successfully\")\n",

    "    if i == 3:\n",
    "        break\n",
    "    print(i)\n",
    "else:\n",
    "    print(\"This will not be printed because the loop was broken\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. The `break` and `continue` Statements\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`break`:** Terminates the loop prematurely.\n",
    "- **`continue`:** Skips the current iteration and proceeds to the next iteration.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Examples:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Using `break`\n",
    "for i in range(10):\n",
    "    if i == 5:\n",
    "        break\n",
    "    print(i)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Using `continue`\n",
    "for i in range(10):\n",
    "    if i % 2 == 0:\n",
    "        continue\n",
    "    print(i)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7. Iterating with `enumerate()`\n",
    "\n",
    "The `enumerate()` function adds a counter to the iteration, returning both the index and the value.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "fruits = [\"apple\", \"banana\", \"cherry\"]\n",
    "for index, fruit in enumerate(fruits):\n",
    "    print(index, fruit)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 8. Iterating with `zip()`\n",
    "\n",
    "The `zip()` function allows you to iterate over multiple sequences in parallel.\n",
    "\n",

    "```python\n",
    "names = [\"Alice\", \"Bob\", \"Charlie\"]\n",
    "ages = [25, 30, 35]\n",
    "for name, age in zip(names, ages):\n",
    "    print(f\"{name} is {age} years old\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 9. List Comprehensions\n",
    "\n",
    "A more concise way to create lists using `for` loops is through list comprehensions.\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, `condition` is a Boolean expression. The loop continues to execute the code block as long as the condition remains `True`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Example of a simple while loop\n",
    "count = 0\n",
    "\n",
    "while count < 5:\n",
    "    print(count)\n",
    "    count += 1\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Infinite Loops\n",
    "\n",
    "If the condition in a `while` loop always evaluates to `True`, the loop will run indefinitely. This is called an infinite loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Example of an infinite loop (use with caution)\n",
    "while True:\n",
    "    print(\"This loop will run forever\")\n",
    "    break  # Use break to stop the loop\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "To prevent infinite loops, ensure that the condition eventually becomes `False`, or use a `break` statement to exit the loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. The `break` Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "The `break` statement is used to exit a `while` loop prematurely, regardless of the condition.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Using break to exit the loop\n",
    "count = 0\n",
    "\n",
    "while count < 10:\n",
    "    print(count)\n",
    "    if count == 5:\n",
    "        break\n",
    "    count += 1\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. The `continue` Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "The `continue` statement is used to skip the current iteration and move to the next iteration of the loop.\n",

    "# Using continue to skip an iteration\n",
    "count = 0\n",

    "        continue\n",
    "    print(count)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Using `else` with `while` Loops\n",
    "\n",
    "An optional `else` block can be used with a `while` loop. The code inside the `else` block is executed when the loop condition becomes `False`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "count = 0\n",
    "\n",
    "while count < 5:\n",
    "    print(count)\n",

    "else:\n",
    "    print(\"This will not be printed because the loop was broken\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. Nested `while` Loops\n",
    "\n",
    "You can nest `while` loops inside other `while` loops. This is useful for working with multi-dimensional data structures.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Nested while loop example\n",
    "i = 1\n",
    "\n",
    "while i <= 3:\n",
    "    j = 1\n",

    "### Useful Operators in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "Python provides a variety of operators that are useful for performing common tasks efficiently. This section covers some of the most commonly used operators, including the `range` function, `enumerate`, `zip`, `in`, and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. The `range` Function\n",
    "\n",
    "The `range` function generates a sequence of numbers, which is often used in `for` loops. It can take up to three arguments: `start`, `stop`, and `step`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Syntax:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "range(stop)\n",
    "range(start, stop)\n",
    "range(start, stop, step)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- `start` (optional): The starting value of the sequence. Defaults to 0.\n",
    "- `stop`: The end value of the sequence (exclusive).\n",
    "- `step` (optional): The difference between each number in the sequence. Defaults to 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Examples:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Using range with stop\n",
    "for i in range(5):\n",
    "    print(i)  # Output: 0 1 2 3 4\n",
    "\n",
    "# Using range with start and stop\n",
    "for i in range(2, 6):\n",
    "    print(i)  # Output: 2 3 4 5\n",
    "\n",
    "# Using range with start, stop, and step\n",
    "for i in range(1, 10, 2):\n",
    "    print(i)  # Output: 1 3 5 7 9\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. The `enumerate` Function\n",
    "\n",
    "The `enumerate` function adds a counter to an iterable and returns it as an enumerate object. This is useful for getting both the index and the value during iteration.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Syntax:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "enumerate(iterable, start=0)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- `iterable`: An iterable object (e.g., list, tuple, string).\n",

    "# Output:\n",
    "# 0 apple\n",
    "# 1 banana\n",
    "# 2 cherry\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. The `zip` Function\n",
    "\n",
    "The `zip` function takes two or more iterables (e.g., lists, tuples) and aggregates them into tuples. It returns an iterator of tuples, where the i-th tuple contains the i-th element from each of the input iterables.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Syntax:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "zip(iterable1, iterable2, ...)\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. The `in` Operator\n",
    "\n",
    "The `in` operator checks if a value is present in a sequence (e.g., list, tuple, string, set, dictionary).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Examples:**\n",

    "\n",
    "# Checking membership in a dictionary (checks keys)\n",
    "print(\"name\" in {\"name\": \"Alice\", \"age\": 25})  # Output: True\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. The `min` and `max` Functions\n",

    "\n",
    "List comprehensions provide a concise way to create lists. They are often more readable and faster than traditional for-loop-based list creation. List comprehensions allow you to generate new lists by applying an expression to each element in an iterable, optionally filtering elements with a condition.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Basic Syntax\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic syntax of a list comprehension is:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "[expression for item in iterable]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **expression**: The expression to apply to each element.\n",
    "- **item**: The variable representing each element in the iterable.\n",
    "- **iterable**: The collection of items to iterate over.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Create a list of squares\n",
    "squares = [x**2 for x in range(10)]\n",

    "matrix = [[row * col for col in range(3)] for row in range(3)]\n",
    "print(matrix)  # Output: [[0, 0, 0], [0, 1, 2], [0, 2, 4]]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Using Functions in List Comprehensions\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "### 1. Instance Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "Instance methods are the most common type of methods in Python. They take the instance (object) itself as the first parameter, conventionally named `self`. Instance methods can access and modify the attributes of the instance.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Defining an Instance Method:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class MyClass:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, value):\n",
    "        self.value = value\n",
    "    \n",
    "    def display_value(self):\n",
    "        print(f\"The value is {self.value}\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Creating an instance of MyClass\n",
    "obj = MyClass(10)\n",
    "obj.display_value()  # Output: The value is 10\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- `__init__`: The initializer method (constructor) which initializes the object’s attributes.\n",
    "- `self`: A reference to the current instance of the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Class Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "Class methods are methods that are bound to the class itself rather than an instance. They take the class as the first parameter, conventionally named `cls`. Class methods can access class-level attributes but not instance-level attributes.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Defining a Class Method:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class MyClass:\n",
    "    class_variable = \"I am a class variable\"\n",
    "\n",
    "    def __init__(self, value):\n",
    "        self.value = value\n",
    "\n",
    "    @classmethod  # Decorator to define a class method\n",
    "    def display_class_variable(cls):\n",
    "        print(cls.class_variable)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Calling the class method\n",
    "MyClass.display_class_variable()  # Output: I am a class variable\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- `@classmethod`: A decorator that defines a method as a class method.\n",
    "- `cls`: A reference to the class itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Static Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "Static methods are methods that do not take either `self` or `cls` as the first parameter. They do not modify object or class state and are utility methods that perform a task related to the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Defining a Static Method:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class MyClass:\n",
    "    @staticmethod  # Decorator to define a static method\n",
    "    def add(a, b):\n",
    "        return a + b\n",
    "\n",
    "# Calling the static method\n",
    "result = MyClass.add(5, 3)\n",
    "print(result)  # Output: 8\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- `@staticmethod`: A decorator that defines a method as a static method.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Special Methods (Magic Methods)\n",
    "\n",
    "Special methods, also known as magic methods or dunder (double underscore) methods, are predefined methods in Python that begin and end with double underscores. They enable objects to implement or override built-in behaviors.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Common Special Methods:**\n",
    "- `__init__(self, ...)`: Constructor method.\n",
    "- `__str__(self)`: Called by `str()` and `print()` to get a string representation of the object.\n",
    "- `__repr__(self)`: Called by `repr()` to get a string representation of the object suitable for debugging.\n",
    "- `__len__(self)`: Called by `len()` to get the length of the object.\n",
    "- `__getitem__(self, key)`: Called to get the value of a specific key (e.g., indexing).\n",
    "- `__setitem__(self, key, value)`: Called to set the value of a specific key.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class MyClass:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, value):\n",
    "        self.value = value\n",
    "    \n",
    "    def __str__(self):\n",
    "        return f\"MyClass with value {self.value}\"\n",
    "    \n",
    "    def __len__(self):\n",
    "        return len(str(self.value))\n",
    "\n",
    "obj = MyClass(12345)\n",
    "print(obj)  # Output: MyClass with value 12345\n",
    "print(len(obj))  # Output: 5\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Method Overriding\n",
    "\n",
    "Method overriding allows a subclass to provide a specific implementation of a method that is already defined in its superclass. It is used to change or extend the behavior of inherited methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Animal:\n",
    "    def sound(self):\n",
    "        print(\"Some generic animal sound\")\n",
    "\n",
    "class Dog(Animal):\n",
    "    def sound(self):\n",
    "        print(\"Bark\")\n",
    "\n",
    "class Cat(Animal):\n",
    "    def sound(self):\n",
    "        print(\"Meow\")\n",
    "\n",
    "dog = Dog()\n",
    "dog.sound()  # Output: Bark\n",
    "\n",
    "cat = Cat()\n",
    "cat.sound()  # Output: Meow\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. Method Resolution Order (MRO)\n",
    "\n",
    "Method Resolution Order (MRO) is the order in which Python looks for a method in a hierarchy of classes. It is especially important in the context of multiple inheritance.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class A:\n",
    "    def method(self):\n",
    "        print(\"A method\")\n",
    "\n",
    "class B(A):\n",
    "    def method(self):\n",
    "        print(\"B method\")\n",
    "\n",
    "class C(A):\n",
    "    def method(self):\n",
    "        print(\"C method\")\n",
    "\n",
    "class D(B, C):\n",
    "    pass\n",
    "\n",
    "obj = D()\n",
    "obj.method()  # Output: B method\n",
    "print(D.mro())  # Output: [<class '__main__.D'>, <class '__main__.B'>, <class '__main__.C'>, <class '__main__.A'>, <class 'object'>]\n",
    "```\n",

    "### Functions in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "A function in Python is a block of organized, reusable code that is used to perform a single, related action. Functions provide better modularity for your application and a high degree of code reusability.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Defining a Function\n",
    "\n",
    "Functions in Python are defined using the `def` keyword, followed by the function name, parentheses containing any parameters, and a colon. The function body is indented.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Syntax:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def function_name(parameters):\n",
    "    \"\"\"Docstring\"\"\"\n",
    "    function_body\n",
    "    return [expression]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **function_name**: The name of the function.\n",
    "- **parameters**: Optional. A comma-separated list of parameters.\n",
    "- **Docstring**: Optional. A string that describes what the function does.\n",
    "- **function_body**: The code block that performs the function’s task.\n",
    "- **return**: Optional. Specifies the value to return to the caller.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def greet(name):\n",
    "    \"\"\"This function greets the person passed as a parameter\"\"\"\n",
    "    print(f\"Hello, {name}!\")\n",
    "\n",
    "greet(\"Alice\")  # Output: Hello, Alice!\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Calling a Function\n",
    "\n",
    "A function is called by using its name followed by parentheses, optionally passing arguments within the parentheses.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def add(a, b):\n",
    "    return a + b\n",
    "\n",
    "result = add(3, 4)\n",
    "print(result)  # Output: 7\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Function Parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "Functions can take various types of parameters:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### a. Positional Arguments\n",
    "\n",
    "Arguments are passed to the function in the same order as the parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def subtract(a, b):\n",
    "    return a - b\n",
    "\n",
    "result = subtract(10, 5)\n",
    "print(result)  # Output: 5\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### b. Keyword Arguments\n",
    "\n",
    "Arguments are passed to the function by explicitly naming each parameter and its value.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def divide(a, b):\n",
    "    return a / b\n",
    "\n",
    "result = divide(b=10, a=50)\n",
    "print(result)  # Output: 5.0\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### c. Default Parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "Parameters can have default values, which are used if no argument is provided.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def greet(name, message=\"Hello\"):\n",
    "    print(f\"{message}, {name}!\")\n",
    "\n",
    "greet(\"Alice\")  # Output: Hello, Alice!\n",
    "greet(\"Bob\", \"Good morning\")  # Output: Good morning, Bob!\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### d. Variable-Length Arguments\n",
    "\n",
    "Functions can accept a variable number of arguments using `*args` for positional arguments and `**kwargs` for keyword arguments.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def print_numbers(*args):\n",
    "    for number in args:\n",
    "        print(number)\n",

    "        print(f\"{key}: {value}\")\n",
    "\n",
    "print_info(name=\"Alice\", age=25)  # Output: name: Alice age: 25\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Return Values\n",
    "\n",
    "Functions can return a value using the `return` statement. If no `return` statement is used, the function returns `None`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def multiply(a, b):\n",
    "    return a * b\n",
    "\n",
    "result = multiply(3, 4)\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Scope and Lifetime of Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Local Scope**: Variables defined inside a function are local to that function and cannot be accessed outside.\n",
    "- **Global Scope**: Variables defined outside any function are global and can be accessed anywhere in the code.\n",
    "- **Nonlocal Scope**: Variables defined in the nearest enclosing scope (not global or local) are nonlocal.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",

    "\n",
    "outer_function()  # Output: I have been modified by inner\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. Anonymous Functions (Lambda Functions)\n",
    "\n",
    "Lambda functions are small anonymous functions defined using the `lambda` keyword. They can have any number of parameters but only one expression.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Syntax:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "lambda arguments: expression\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "```python\n",

    "pairs.sort(key=lambda pair: pair[1])\n",
    "print(pairs)  # Output: [(4, 'four'), (1, 'one'), (3, 'three'), (2, 'two')]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7. Higher-Order Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "Functions that take other functions as arguments or return functions are called higher-order functions. Examples include `map()`, `filter()`, and `reduce()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Using map to apply a function to all items in a list\n",
    "numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4]\n",
    "squared = map(lambda x: x**2, numbers)\n",
    "print(list(squared))  # Output: [1, 4, 9, 16]\n",
    "\n",
    "# Using filter to filter out items\n",
    "evens = filter(lambda x: x % 2 == 0, numbers)\n",
    "print(list(evens))  # Output: [2, 4]\n",
    "\n",
    "# Using reduce to apply a function cumulatively\n",
    "from functools import reduce\n",
    "sum_numbers = reduce(lambda x, y: x + y, numbers)\n",
    "print(sum_numbers)  # Output: 10\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 8. Decorators\n",
    "\n",
    "Decorators are a powerful feature that allows you to modify the behavior of a function or class method. They are defined using the `@decorator_name` syntax and are applied to functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",

    "### `*args` and `**kwargs` in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "`*args` and `**kwargs` are used in function definitions to allow a variable number of arguments. This makes functions flexible and able to handle a wide range of input arguments.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. `*args` (Non-Keyword Variable Arguments)\n",
    "\n",
    "The `*args` syntax allows a function to accept any number of positional arguments. In the function definition, `*args` collects additional positional arguments as a tuple.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Syntax:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def function_name(*args):\n",
    "    # function body\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def greet(*names):\n",
    "    \"\"\"Greet all the names in the argument\"\"\"\n",
    "    for name in names:\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, `*names` collects all the positional arguments into a tuple.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. `**kwargs` (Keyword Variable Arguments)\n",
    "\n",
    "The `**kwargs` syntax allows a function to accept any number of keyword (named) arguments. In the function definition, `**kwargs` collects these arguments as a dictionary.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Syntax:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def function_name(**kwargs):\n",
    "    # function body\n",

    "# name: Alice\n",
    "# age: 30\n",
    "# city: New York\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, `**details` collects all the keyword arguments into a dictionary.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Using `*args` and `**kwargs` Together\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use `*args` and `**kwargs` together in the same function to accept both positional and keyword arguments. The order is important: `*args` must come before `**kwargs` in the function definition.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def combine(*args, **kwargs):\n",
    "    \"\"\"Combines positional and keyword arguments\"\"\"\n",

    "# Keyword arguments: {'name': 'Alice', 'age': 30}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Passing `*args` and `**kwargs` to Other Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "You can pass `*args` and `**kwargs` to other functions that accept variable arguments. This is useful for function wrappers or decorators.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def outer_function(*args, **kwargs):\n",
    "    inner_function(*args, **kwargs)\n",

    "### Map Function\n",
    "\n",
    "The `map()` function applies a given function to all items in an input list (or any iterable) and returns an iterator that yields the results. It is useful for transforming data without using explicit loops.\n",

    "### Nested Statements and Scope in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, nested statements refer to statements placed inside other statements. Scope determines the visibility and lifetime of variables. Understanding nested statements and scope is essential for writing clear and bug-free code.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Nested Statements\n",
    "\n",
    "Nested statements occur when you place one or more statements inside another statement. This is commonly seen in control structures like loops and conditionals.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example: Nested if statements:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "x = 10\n",
    "y = 20\n",
    "\n",
    "if x < 15:\n",
    "    if y > 15:\n",

    "# i: 2, j: 0\n",
    "# i: 2, j: 1\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Scope\n",
    "\n",
    "Scope refers to the region of the code where a variable is accessible. Python has different types of scope:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Local Scope**: Variables defined inside a function.\n",
    "- **Enclosing Scope**: Variables in the local scope of enclosing functions.\n",
    "- **Global Scope**: Variables defined at the top-level of a script or module.\n",
    "- **Built-in Scope**: Special reserved names that are part of Python's built-in namespace.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Local Scope\n",
    "\n",
    "Variables declared inside a function are local to that function. They are not accessible outside the function.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def my_function():\n",
    "    local_var = \"I'm local\"\n",
    "    print(local_var)\n",
    "\n",
    "my_function()  # Output: I'm local\n",
    "print(local_var)  # Error: NameError: name 'local_var' is not defined\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Enclosing Scope (Nested Functions)\n",
    "\n",
    "When functions are nested, the inner function can access variables from the enclosing (outer) function's scope.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def outer_function():\n",
    "    outer_var = \"I'm outer\"\n",
    "\n",
    "    def inner_function():\n",

    "        print(outer_var)\n",
    "        print(inner_var)\n",
    "\n",
    "    inner_function()\n",

    "    # I'm inner\n",
    "\n",
    "outer_function()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Global Scope\n",
    "\n",
    "Variables defined outside of any function or class are in the global scope. They can be accessed from anywhere in the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "global_var = \"I'm global\"\n",
    "\n",
    "def my_function():\n",
    "    print(global_var)\n",
    "\n",
    "my_function()  # Output: I'm global\n",
    "print(global_var)  # Output: I'm global\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. Built-in Scope\n",
    "\n",
    "Built-in scope contains special reserved names that are part of Python’s built-in namespace, like `print()`, `len()`, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "print(\"Hello, World!\")  # Output: Hello, World!\n",
    "print(len([1, 2, 3]))  # Output: 3\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7. The `global` Keyword\n",
    "\n",
    "The `global` keyword is used to modify a global variable inside a function. Without the `global` keyword, any assignment to a variable inside a function creates a local variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "global_var = \"I'm global\"\n",
    "\n",
    "def my_function():\n",
    "    global global_var\n",

    "my_function()  # Output: Modified global\n",
    "print(global_var)  # Output: Modified global\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 8. The `nonlocal` Keyword\n",
    "\n",
    "The `nonlocal` keyword is used to modify a variable in the nearest enclosing scope that is not global. It is useful in nested functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def outer_function():\n",
    "    outer_var = \"I'm outer\"\n",
    "\n",
    "    def inner_function():\n",

    "        print(outer_var)\n",
    "\n",
    "    inner_function()\n",
    "    print(outer_var)\n",
    "\n",
    "outer_function()\n",
    "# Output:\n",
    "# Modified outer\n",
    "# Modified outer\n",

    "\n",
    "### 9. LEGB Rule\n",
    "\n",
    "The LEGB rule defines the order in which Python looks up variables:\n",
    "- **L**ocal: Inside the current function.\n",
    "- **E**nclosing: Inside enclosing functions.\n",
    "- **G**lobal: At the top-level of the script/module.\n",
    "- **B**uilt-in: In the built-in namespace.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "```python\n",

    "    print(x)  # Output: enclosing\n",
    "\n",
    "outer()\n",
    "print(x)  # Output: global\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 10. Nested Functions with Different Scopes\n",
    "\n",
    "Nested functions can access and modify variables from their enclosing scope, but they need `global` or `nonlocal` to modify variables in the global or enclosing scope respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def outer():\n",
    "    outer_var = \"outer\"\n",
