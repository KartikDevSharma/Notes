    "- **Optimization**: Converts bytecode into optimized machine code during runtime, improving the performance of Java applications.\n",
    "- **Adaptive**: Continuously profiles and optimizes frequently executed code paths, adapting to the application's runtime behavior.\n",
    "- **Caching**: Stores compiled machine code in a cache to avoid repeated compilation and improve execution speed.\n",

    "### Conclusion\n",
    "Bytecode and machine code are integral to understanding how Java and other programming languages are executed. Bytecode serves as an intermediate representation that provides platform independence and portability, while machine code is the final, hardware-specific instructions executed by the CPU. The JVM plays a crucial role in interpreting or compiling bytecode into machine code, leveraging the JIT compiler for runtime optimizations to enhance performance. Understanding these concepts is essential for developers to appreciate the execution process and performance characteristics of Java applications.\n",
