    "## Java Basic Syntax\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **Introduction to Java Syntax**\n",
    "Java syntax is the set of rules defining how a Java program is written and interpreted. Java programs are made up of classes and methods, and they use a specific syntax for declaring variables, methods, and other structures.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **Structure of a Java Program**\n",
    "A typical Java program has the following structure:\n",
    "\n",
    "```java\n",
    "// A simple Java program\n",
    "public class MyFirstClass {\n",
    "    public static void main(String[] args) {\n",
    "        System.out.println(\"Hello, World!\");\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Components:**\n",
    "- **Class Definition:** `public class MyFirstClass` - Every Java program must have at least one class definition. The class name should match the filename.\n",
    "- **Main Method:** `public static void main(String[] args)` - This is the entry point of any Java application. It is always defined as `public static void main(String[] args)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. **Comments in Java**\n",
    "Comments are non-executable statements used to make the code more readable.\n",
    "- **Single-line comments:** Use `//` for single-line comments.\n",
    "  ```java\n",
    "  // This is a single-line comment\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "- **Multi-line comments:** Use `/* ... */` for multi-line comments.\n",
    "  ```java\n",
    "  /* This is a \n",
    "     multi-line comment */\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "- **Documentation comments:** Use `/** ... */` for comments that can be used to generate documentation.\n",
    "  ```java\n",
    "  /**\n",
    "   * This is a documentation comment\n",
    "   */\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. **Data Types in Java**\n",
    "Java is a strongly-typed language, which means every variable must be declared with a data type.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Primitive Data Types:**\n",
    "- **byte:** 8-bit integer, `byte b = 10;`\n",
    "- **short:** 16-bit integer, `short s = 2000;`\n",
    "- **int:** 32-bit integer, `int i = 123456;`\n",
    "- **long:** 64-bit integer, `long l = 123456789L;`\n",
    "- **float:** 32-bit floating point, `float f = 12.34f;`\n",
    "- **double:** 64-bit floating point, `double d = 123.456;`\n",
    "- **char:** 16-bit Unicode character, `char c = 'A';`\n",
    "- **boolean:** true or false, `boolean bool = true;`\n",
    "\n",
    "**Non-Primitive Data Types:**\n",
    "- **String:** A sequence of characters, `String str = \"Hello\";`\n",
    "- **Arrays:** Collection of elements of the same type, `int[] arr = {1, 2, 3};`\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. **Variables in Java**\n",
    "Variables are containers for storing data values. Each variable in Java must be declared before it is used.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Syntax:**\n",
    "```java\n",
    "dataType variableName = value;\n",
    "```\n",
    "**Examples:**\n",
    "```java\n",
    "int number = 5;\n",
    "String message = \"Hello, World!\";\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. **Operators in Java**\n",
    "Operators are special symbols that perform specific operations on one, two, or three operands, and then return a result.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Types of Operators:**\n",
    "- **Arithmetic Operators:** `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`\n",
    "- **Relational Operators:** `==`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`\n",
    "- **Logical Operators:** `&&`, `||`, `!`\n",
    "- **Bitwise Operators:** `&`, `|`, `^`, `~`, `<<`, `>>`, `>>>`\n",
    "- **Assignment Operators:** `=`, `+=`, `-=`, `*=`, `/=`, `%=`\n",
    "- **Unary Operators:** `+`, `-`, `++`, `--`, `!`\n",
    "- **Ternary Operator:** `? :`\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7. **Control Flow Statements**\n",
    "Control flow statements determine the order in which statements are executed.\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Conditional Statements:**\n",
    "- **if Statement:**\n",
    "  ```java\n",
    "  if (condition) {\n",
    "      // code to be executed if condition is true\n",
    "  }\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "- **if-else Statement:**\n",
    "  ```java\n",
    "  if (condition) {\n",
    "      // code to be executed if condition is true\n",
    "  } else {\n",
    "      // code to be executed if condition is false\n",
    "  }\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "- **else-if Statement:**\n",
    "  ```java\n",
    "  if (condition1) {\n",
    "      // code to be executed if condition1 is true\n",
    "  } else if (condition2) {\n",
    "      // code to be executed if condition2 is true\n",
    "  } else {\n",
    "      // code to be executed if all conditions are false\n",
    "  }\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **switch Statement:**\n",
    "  ```java\n",
    "  switch (variable) {\n",
    "      case value1:\n",
    "          // code to be executed if variable equals value1\n",
    "          break;\n",
    "      case value2:\n",
    "          // code to be executed if variable equals value2\n",
    "          break;\n",
    "      default:\n",
    "          // code to be executed if variable doesn't match any case\n",
    "  }\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Loop Statements:**\n",
    "- **while Loop:**\n",
    "  ```java\n",
    "  while (condition) {\n",
    "      // code to be executed as long as condition is true\n",
    "  }\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "- **do-while Loop:**\n",
    "  ```java\n",
    "  do {\n",
    "      // code to be executed\n",
    "  } while (condition);\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "- **for Loop:**\n",
    "  ```java\n",
    "  for (initialization; condition; increment/decrement) {\n",
    "      // code to be executed\n",
    "  }\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "- **for-each Loop:**\n",
    "  ```java\n",
    "  for (dataType item : collection) {\n",
    "      // code to be executed for each item\n",
    "  }\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 8. **Methods in Java**\n",
    "Methods are blocks of code that perform a specific task. They help in code reusability.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Syntax:**\n",
    "```java\n",
    "returnType methodName(parameters) {\n",
    "    // method body\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "```java\n",
    "public int add(int a, int b) {\n",
    "    return a + b;\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 9. **Arrays in Java**\n",
    "An array is a collection of elements of the same type stored in a contiguous memory location.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Syntax:**\n",
    "```java\n",
    "dataType[] arrayName = new dataType[size];\n",
    "```\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "```java\n",
    "int[] numbers = new int[5];\n",
    "int[] primes = {2, 3, 5, 7, 11};\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 10. **Classes and Objects**\n",
    "Java is an object-oriented programming language. Everything in Java is associated with classes and objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Class Definition:**\n",
    "```java\n",
    "public class MyClass {\n",
    "    // fields\n",
    "    int x = 5;\n",
    "\n",
    "    // methods\n",
    "    public void myMethod() {\n",
    "        // code\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Creating an Object:**\n",
    "```java\n",
    "MyClass myObj = new MyClass();\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 11. **Access Modifiers**\n",
    "Access modifiers set the accessibility of classes, methods, and other members. Java has four access modifiers:\n",
    "- **private:** Accessible only within the same class.\n",
    "- **default (no modifier):** Accessible only within the same package.\n",
    "- **protected:** Accessible within the same package and subclasses.\n",
    "- **public:** Accessible from any other class.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "```java\n",
    "public class MyClass {\n",
    "    private int x;\n",
    "    public int y;\n",
    "    protected int z;\n",
    "    int a; // default\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 12. **Packages**\n",
    "Packages are used to group related classes. They help avoid name conflicts and can be imported using the `import` keyword.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Creating a Package:**\n",
    "```java\n",
    "package mypackage;\n",
    "public class MyClass {\n",
    "    // class code\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Importing a Package:**\n",
    "```java\n",
    "import mypackage.MyClass;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 13. **Exception Handling**\n",
    "Exceptions are problems that occur during the execution of a program. Java provides a robust mechanism to handle exceptions using `try`, `catch`, `finally`, and `throw` keywords.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "```java\n",
    "try {\n",
    "    // code that may throw an exception\n",
    "} catch (ExceptionType e) {\n",
    "    // code to handle the exception\n",
    "} finally {\n",
    "    // code to be executed regardless of an exception\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Throwing an Exception:**\n",
    "```java\n",
    "public void myMethod() throws IOException {\n",
    "    // code that may throw an IOException\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 14. **Basic Input and Output**\n",
    "Java provides various classes for input and output operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Reading Input:**\n",
    "```java\n",
    "import java.util.Scanner;\n",
    "\n",
    "Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);\n",
    "System.out.println(\"Enter a number:\");\n",
    "int number = scanner.nextInt();\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Writing Output:**\n",
    "```java\n",
    "System.out.println(\"Hello, World!\");\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 15. **Conclusion**\n",
    "Understanding the basic syntax of Java is crucial for writing effective Java programs. This includes understanding the structure of a Java program, how to declare variables and methods, use control flow statements, handle exceptions, and perform input and output operations.\n",

    "## First Java Program: \n",
    "\n",
    "### Introduction to Java\n",
    "\n",
    "Java is a high-level, class-based, object-oriented programming language that is designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. It is widely used for building enterprise-scale applications. Java is platform-independent at both the source and binary levels, thanks to the Java Virtual Machine (JVM).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Setting Up the Environment\n",
    "\n",
    "Before writing your first Java program, you need to set up the Java Development Kit (JDK) on your computer. The JDK includes the Java Runtime Environment (JRE), an interpreter/loader (Java), a compiler (javac), an archiver (jar), and other tools needed to develop Java applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Steps to Set Up JDK:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Download JDK:**\n",
    "   - Visit the [Oracle JDK download page](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html).\n",
    "   - Download the appropriate version for your operating system.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Install JDK:**\n",
    "   - Follow the installation instructions specific to your OS.\n",
    "   - For Windows: Run the installer and follow the prompts.\n",
    "   - For macOS: Open the `.dmg` file and drag the JDK to your Applications folder.\n",
    "   - For Linux: Use package managers like `apt` or `yum` to install the JDK.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Set Up Environment Variables:**\n",
    "   - For Windows: Add the JDK's `bin` directory to the PATH environment variable.\n",
    "   - For macOS/Linux: Add `export PATH=$PATH:/path/to/jdk/bin` to your shell profile file (`.bashrc`, `.bash_profile`, or `.zshrc`).\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Verify Installation:**\n",
    "   - Open a terminal or command prompt.\n",
    "   - Type `java -version` and `javac -version` to ensure both commands display the installed versions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Writing Your First Java Program\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Program Structure\n",
    "\n",
    "A basic Java program includes:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Class Definition:** Every Java application must have at least one class definition that matches the file name.\n",
    "- **Main Method:** The entry point of the application. It must be `public`, `static`, and `void` with a `String[]` argument.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example: HelloWorld.java\n",
    "\n",
    "```java\n",
    "// This is a single-line comment\n",
    "/*\n",
    " * This is a multi-line comment\n",
    " */\n",
    "\n",
    "public class HelloWorld { // Class definition\n",
    "    // The main method\n",
    "    public static void main(String[] args) {\n",
    "        // Print statement\n",
    "        System.out.println(\"Hello, World!\");\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Compiling and Running Your Java Program\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Save Your Program:**\n",
    "   - Save the file with the name `HelloWorld.java`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Compile the Program:**\n",
    "   - Open a terminal or command prompt.\n",
    "   - Navigate to the directory containing your Java file.\n",
    "   - Run the command: `javac HelloWorld.java`\n",
    "   - This will create a `HelloWorld.class` file containing the bytecode.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Run the Program:**\n",
    "   - In the terminal, run: `java HelloWorld`\n",
    "   - You should see the output: `Hello, World!`\n",
    "\n",
    "### Explanation of the Code\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Class Declaration:**\n",
    "   ```java\n",
    "   public class HelloWorld {\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   - `public`: Access modifier, meaning this class is accessible by any other class.\n",
    "   - `class`: Keyword to declare a class.\n",
    "   - `HelloWorld`: The name of the class. Must match the file name.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Main Method:**\n",
    "   ```java\n",
    "   public static void main(String[] args) {\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   - `public`: Access modifier, allowing the JVM to execute this method.\n",
    "   - `static`: Allows the JVM to invoke the method without creating an instance of the class.\n",
    "   - `void`: Indicates that the method does not return any value.\n",
    "   - `main`: The name of the method. This is the entry point of any Java application.\n",
    "   - `String[] args`: An array of `String` arguments passed to the program. Not used in this example but useful for command-line arguments.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Print Statement:**\n",
    "   ```java\n",
    "   System.out.println(\"Hello, World!\");\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   - `System`: A final class from the core library.\n",
    "   - `out`: A static member of the `System` class, representing the standard output stream.\n",
    "   - `println`: A method of the `PrintStream` class, used to print a line of text to the console.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Common Errors and Troubleshooting\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Class Not Found:**\n",
    "   - Ensure the class name matches the file name.\n",
    "   - Check the compilation step for errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Main Method Not Found:**\n",
    "   - Verify the main method signature: `public static void main(String[] args)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Syntax Errors:**\n",
    "   - Ensure all braces `{}`, parentheses `()`, and semicolons `;` are correctly placed.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Comments in Java\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Single-line comments:** Use `//` for comments that occupy a single line.\n",
    "- **Multi-line comments:** Use `/* */` for comments that span multiple lines.\n",
    "- **Javadoc comments:** Use `/** */` for comments that can be used to generate documentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "Congratulations! You've written, compiled, and executed your first Java program. Understanding this basic structure is crucial as it forms the foundation for more complex applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Next Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Experiment:** Modify the HelloWorld program to print different messages.\n",
    "- **Explore:** Learn about different data types, variables, and operators.\n",

    "## Datatypes in Java\n",
    "\n",
    "### Introduction to Datatypes\n",
    "\n",
    "In Java, datatypes specify the different sizes and values that can be stored in variables. Java is a statically-typed language, which means all variables must be declared with a datatype before they can be used. This helps in catching errors at compile time and improving performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Categories of Datatypes\n",
    "\n",
    "Java has two main categories of datatypes:\n",
    "\n",

    "2. **Non-Primitive (Reference) Datatypes**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Primitive Datatypes\n",
    "\n",
    "Primitive datatypes are the most basic data types available in Java. They are predefined by the language and named by a keyword. There are eight primitive datatypes:\n",

    "#### 1. `byte`\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Size:** 1 byte (8 bits)\n",
    "- **Range:** -128 to 127\n",
    "- **Default Value:** 0\n",
    "- **Usage:** Useful for saving memory in large arrays and also in streams of data from networks or files.\n",
    "\n",
    "```java\n",
    "byte exampleByte = 10;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. `short`\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Size:** 2 bytes (16 bits)\n",
    "- **Range:** -32,768 to 32,767\n",
    "- **Default Value:** 0\n",
    "- **Usage:** Can be used to save memory in large arrays, in situations where the memory savings actually matter.\n",
    "\n",
    "```java\n",
    "short exampleShort = 1000;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. `int`\n",

    "- **Range:** -2^63 to 2^63 - 1 (approximately -9.2 quintillion to 9.2 quintillion)\n",
    "- **Default Value:** 0L\n",
    "- **Usage:** When a wider range than `int` is needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "```java\n",
    "long exampleLong = 100000L;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 5. `float`\n",

    "### Type Conversion\n",
    "\n",
    "Type conversion is the process of converting a variable from one data type to another. There are two types of conversions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Implicit Type Conversion (Widening Conversion)**\n",
    "   - Automatically performed by the Java compiler.\n",
    "   - Converts a smaller type to a larger type.\n",
    "   - Examples: `byte` to `short`, `short` to `int`, `int` to `long`, `float` to `double`.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```java\n",
    "   int intVal = 100;\n",
    "   long longVal = intVal; // Implicit conversion\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Explicit Type Conversion (Narrowing Conversion)**\n",
    "   - Must be explicitly performed by the programmer.\n",
    "   - Converts a larger type to a smaller type.\n",
    "   - May result in data loss.\n",
    "   - Syntax: `datatype variable = (datatype) value;`\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```java\n",
    "   double doubleVal = 100.04;\n",
    "   int intVal = (int) doubleVal; // Explicit conversion\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Wrapper Classes\n",
    "\n",
    "Primitive datatypes have corresponding classes in the Java.lang package known as wrapper classes. These are used to convert primitive types into objects and vice versa.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **byte:** `Byte`\n",
    "- **short:** `Short`\n",
    "- **int:** `Integer`\n",
    "- **long:** `Long`\n",
    "- **float:** `Float`\n",
    "- **double:** `Double`\n",
    "- **char:** `Character`\n",
    "- **boolean:** `Boolean`\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```java\n",
    "int primitiveInt = 5;\n",
    "Integer wrapperInt = Integer.valueOf(primitiveInt); // Boxing\n",
    "int newPrimitiveInt = wrapperInt.intValue(); // Unboxing\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Autoboxing and Unboxing\n",
    "\n",
    "Autoboxing is the automatic conversion of primitive types to their corresponding wrapper classes. Unboxing is the reverse process.\n",
    "\n",
    "```java\n",
    "int primitiveInt = 5;\n",
    "Integer wrapperInt = primitiveInt; // Autoboxing\n",
    "int newPrimitiveInt = wrapperInt; // Unboxing\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding datatypes is fundamental to programming in Java. Primitive datatypes provide a foundation for storing simple values, while non-primitive datatypes offer more complex data structures. Knowing how to use and convert between different types efficiently is essential for writing robust Java programs.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Primitive Datatypes\n",
    "\n",
    "Primitive datatypes are the most basic data types in Java. They are predefined by the language and named by a reserved keyword. They represent single values and are not objects.\n",

    "#### Characteristics of Primitive Datatypes:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Fixed Size:** Each primitive type has a fixed size and range.\n",
    "2. **Not Objects:** Primitive types are not objects and do not have methods associated with them.\n",
    "3. **Efficiency:** They are more efficient in terms of memory and performance compared to non-primitive types.\n",
    "4. **Stored in Stack Memory:** Primitive variables are stored directly in the stack memory.\n",

    "   - Default Value: '\\u0000'\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **boolean**\n",
    "   - Size: 1 bit (but not precisely defined, as the size can be platform-dependent)\n",
    "   - Values: `true` or `false`\n",
    "   - Default Value: `false`\n",
    "\n",

    "#### Characteristics of Non-Primitive Datatypes:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Variable Size:** The size of non-primitive types can vary.\n",
    "2. **Objects:** Non-primitive types are objects and have methods and properties associated with them.\n",
    "3. **Less Efficient:** They are less efficient in terms of memory and performance compared to primitive types.\n",
    "4. **Stored in Heap Memory:** Reference variables store the address (reference) of the memory location where the data is stored in the heap memory.\n",

    "## Java Identifiers\n",
    "\n",
    "### Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Identifiers in Java are names given to elements in a program such as variables, methods, classes, packages, and interfaces. They are fundamental to any Java program as they provide a way to refer to various programming elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Rules for Naming Identifiers\n",
    "\n",
    "Java identifiers must adhere to specific rules to ensure they are valid and can be used by the Java compiler without errors:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Letters and Digits:** Identifiers can only contain letters (both uppercase and lowercase), digits (0-9), underscores (_), and dollar signs ($).\n",
    "   - Valid: `myVariable`, `my_variable`, `my$variable`\n",
    "   - Invalid: `my-variable` (contains a hyphen), `2ndVariable` (starts with a digit)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Start with a Letter, Underscore, or Dollar Sign:** Identifiers must not begin with a digit.\n",
    "   - Valid: `_myVariable`, `$myVariable`\n",
    "   - Invalid: `123variable`, `2ndVariable`\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Case Sensitivity:** Identifiers are case-sensitive, which means `myVariable` and `myvariable` are considered different identifiers.\n",
    "   - `MyVariable`, `myvariable`, `MYVARIABLE` are all distinct.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **No Reserved Keywords:** Identifiers cannot be Java reserved keywords (e.g., `int`, `class`, `void`).\n",
    "   - Invalid: `int`, `class`\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Unlimited Length:** Identifiers can be of any length, but it is advisable to keep them manageable and readable.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Types of Identifiers\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Variables:** Names given to memory locations.\n",
    "   - Example: `int age;`\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Methods:** Names given to functions or procedures.\n",
    "   - Example: `void calculateAge() { }`\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Classes:** Names given to class definitions.\n",
    "   - Example: `public class Person { }`\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Interfaces:** Names given to interface definitions.\n",
    "   - Example: `public interface Animal { }`\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Packages:** Names given to package definitions.\n",
    "   - Example: `package com.example.myapp;`\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conventions for Naming Identifiers\n",
    "\n",
    "While Java does not enforce naming conventions, following standard naming conventions makes the code more readable and maintainable:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Classes and Interfaces:**\n",
    "   - Use **PascalCase** (also known as UpperCamelCase).\n",
    "   - Start with an uppercase letter.\n",
    "   - Example: `MyClass`, `Person`, `AnimalInterface`\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Methods:**\n",
    "   - Use **camelCase**.\n",
    "   - Start with a lowercase letter.\n",
    "   - Example: `calculateAge()`, `getName()`, `setAge()`\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Variables:**\n",
    "   - Use **camelCase**.\n",
    "   - Start with a lowercase letter.\n",
    "   - Example: `age`, `firstName`, `totalAmount`\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Constants:**\n",
    "   - Use **ALL_UPPERCASE_WITH_UNDERSCORES**.\n",
    "   - Example: `PI`, `MAX_VALUE`, `DEFAULT_TIMEOUT`\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Packages:**\n",
    "   - Use **lowercase** letters.\n",
    "   - Typically use the reverse domain name to ensure uniqueness.\n",
    "   - Example: `com.example.myapp`, `org.apache.commons`\n",
    "\n",
    "### Examples of Identifiers\n",
    "\n",
    "```java\n",
    "// Class name (PascalCase)\n",
    "public class Employee {\n",
    "    \n",
    "    // Variable name (camelCase)\n",
    "    private int employeeId;\n",
    "    private String employeeName;\n",
    "    \n",
    "    // Constant name (ALL_UPPERCASE_WITH_UNDERSCORES)\n",
    "    public static final int MAX_AGE = 65;\n",
    "    \n",
    "    // Method name (camelCase)\n",
    "    public void setEmployeeName(String name) {\n",
    "        this.employeeName = name;\n",
    "    }\n",
    "    \n",
    "    // Method name (camelCase)\n",
    "    public String getEmployeeName() {\n",
    "        return employeeName;\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Reserved Keywords in Java\n",
    "\n",
    "Java has a set of reserved keywords that cannot be used as identifiers. These keywords have a predefined meaning in the language syntax.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### List of Reserved Keywords:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "abstract    continue    for          new         switch\n",
    "assert      default     goto*        package     synchronized\n",

    "## Java Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "### Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In Java, variables are used to store data that can be manipulated and retrieved throughout a program. Each variable in Java must be declared with a specific type, which determines the kind of data it can hold.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Types of Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "Java variables can be classified into three main categories:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Local Variables**\n",
    "2. **Instance Variables (Non-Static Fields)**\n",
    "3. **Class Variables (Static Fields)**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Variable Declaration and Initialization\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Declaration\n",
    "\n",
    "To declare a variable, you specify the variable's type and name. The syntax is:\n",
    "\n",
    "```java\n",
    "type variableName;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Initialization\n",
    "\n",
    "Variables can be initialized when they are declared. The syntax is:\n",
    "\n",
    "```java\n",
    "type variableName = value;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "```java\n",
    "// Declaration\n",
    "int age;\n",
    "double salary;\n",
    "\n",
    "// Initialization\n",
    "age = 25;\n",
    "salary = 50000.0;\n",
    "\n",
    "// Declaration and Initialization\n",
    "String name = \"John\";\n",
    "boolean isEmployed = true;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Local Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "Local variables are declared inside methods, constructors, or blocks. They are created when the method, constructor, or block is entered and destroyed when it is exited. Local variables do not have default values and must be initialized before use.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Characteristics:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Scope: Within the method, constructor, or block where they are declared.\n",
    "- Lifetime: Exists only during the execution of the method, constructor, or block.\n",
    "- No default value: Must be initialized explicitly.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```java\n",
    "public class Example {\n",
    "    public void myMethod() {\n",
    "        int localVar = 10; // Local variable\n",
    "        System.out.println(localVar);\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Instance Variables (Non-Static Fields)\n",
    "\n",
    "Instance variables are declared in a class but outside any method, constructor, or block. They are created when an object of the class is instantiated and destroyed when the object is destroyed. Instance variables hold values that must be unique to each instance of a class.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "- Scope: Within the object of the class.\n",
    "- Lifetime: Exists as long as the object exists.\n",
    "- Default value: If not initialized, instance variables are given default values (0, null, false, etc.).\n",

    "#### Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```java\n",
    "public class Example {\n",
    "    int instanceVar; // Instance variable\n",
    "\n",
    "    public static void main(String[] args) {\n",

    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Class Variables (Static Fields)\n",
    "\n",
    "Class variables, also known as static fields, are declared with the `static` keyword in a class but outside any method, constructor, or block. There is only one copy of a class variable, regardless of the number of objects created from the class. Class variables are shared among all instances of a class.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Characteristics:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Scope: Within the class and accessible by all objects of the class.\n",
    "- Lifetime: Exists from the time it is declared until the program terminates.\n",
    "- Default value: If not initialized, class variables are given default values (0, null, false, etc.).\n",

    "#### Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```java\n",
    "public class Example {\n",
    "    static int staticVar; // Class variable\n",
    "\n",
    "    public static void main(String[] args) {\n",
    "        Example obj1 = new Example();\n",
    "        Example obj2 = new Example();\n",
    "        obj1.staticVar = 5;\n",
    "        System.out.println(obj2.staticVar); // Output is 5, shared among instances\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Variable Scope\n",
    "\n",
    "The scope of a variable determines where the variable is accessible within the program.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Local Variables**: Scope is limited to the block, method, or constructor in which they are declared.\n",
    "- **Instance Variables**: Scope is within the object of the class.\n",
    "- **Class Variables**: Scope is within the class and shared among all instances.\n",

    "\n",
    "- **Class Variables and Instance Variables**: Use camelCase (e.g., `myVariable`).\n",
    "- **Constants**: Use all uppercase letters with underscores to separate words (e.g., `MAX_VALUE`).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Types of Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "Variables in Java can hold different types of data, and each type requires a specific data type to be declared. Java has two categories of data types:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Primitive Data Types**: Includes byte, short, int, long, float, double, char, and boolean.\n",
    "2. **Non-Primitive Data Types**: Includes String, Arrays, Classes, Interfaces, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Primitive Data Types\n",
    "\n",
    "| Data Type | Default Value | Size     | Description                                    |\n",
    "|-----------|---------------|----------|------------------------------------------------|\n",
    "| byte      | 0             | 8-bit    | Stores whole numbers from -128 to 127          |\n",
    "| short     | 0             | 16-bit   | Stores whole numbers from -32,768 to 32,767    |\n",
    "| int       | 0             | 32-bit   | Stores whole numbers from -2^31 to 2^31-1      |\n",
    "| long      | 0L            | 64-bit   | Stores whole numbers from -2^63 to 2^63-1      |\n",
    "| float     | 0.0f          | 32-bit   | Stores fractional numbers, sufficient for 6-7 decimal digits |\n",
    "| double    | 0.0d          | 64-bit   | Stores fractional numbers, sufficient for 15 decimal digits  |\n",
    "| char      | '\\u0000'      | 16-bit   | Stores a single 16-bit Unicode character       |\n",
    "| boolean   | false         | 1-bit    | Stores true or false values                    |\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Non-Primitive Data Types\n",
    "\n",
    "Non-primitive data types are also known as reference types because they refer to objects. These types are created by the programmer and are not predefined in Java.\n",
    "\n",
    "| Data Type | Description                                  |\n",
    "|-----------|----------------------------------------------|\n",

    "| Arrays    | Holds multiple values of the same type       |\n",
    "| Classes   | Defines a blueprint for objects              |\n",
    "| Interfaces| Defines a contract that classes can implement|\n",
    "\n",
    "### Type Conversion\n",
    "\n",
    "Type conversion is the process of converting one data type to another. There are two types of type conversion:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Implicit Type Conversion (Widening Conversion)**: Automatic conversion by the compiler from a smaller data type to a larger data type.\n",
    "2. **Explicit Type Conversion (Narrowing Conversion)**: Manually converting a larger data type to a smaller data type using casting.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Implicit Type Conversion\n",
    "\n",
    "```java\n",
    "int a = 10;\n",
    "double b = a; // Automatic conversion from int to double\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Explicit Type Conversion\n",
    "\n",
    "```java\n",
    "double a = 10.5;\n",
    "int b = (int) a; // Manual conversion from double to int\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Variable Shadowing\n",
    "\n",
    "Variable shadowing occurs when a variable declared within a certain scope (e.g., a method or block) has the same name as a variable declared in an outer scope. The inner variable \"shadows\" the outer variable, making the outer variable inaccessible within the inner scope.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```java\n",
    "public class Example {\n",
    "    int x = 10; // Instance variable\n",
    "\n",
    "    public void myMethod() {\n",
    "        int x = 20; // Local variable shadows instance variable\n",
    "        System.out.println(x); // Output is 20\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Final Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "A final variable in Java is a constant. Once a final variable is assigned a value, it cannot be changed. Final variables are often declared using uppercase letters with underscores separating words.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```java\n",
    "public class Example {\n",
    "    final int MAX_VALUE = 100;\n",
    "\n",
    "    public static void main(String[] args) {\n",
    "        Example obj = new Example();\n",
    "        System.out.println(obj.MAX_VALUE);\n",
    "        // obj.MAX_VALUE = 200; // Error: Cannot assign a value to final variable\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "Variables are a fundamental concept in Java programming, allowing developers to store, manipulate, and retrieve data. Understanding the different types of variables, their scopes, and how to use them effectively is crucial for writing robust and maintainable Java code.\n",

    "## Scope of Variables in Java\n",
    "\n",
    "### Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In Java, the scope of a variable refers to the part of the program where the variable is accessible. Understanding variable scope is crucial for writing clean, efficient, and error-free code. There are several types of variable scopes in Java, each with specific rules about where variables can be declared and accessed.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Types of Variable Scopes\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Class Scope (Static Variables)**\n",
    "2. **Instance Scope (Instance Variables)**\n",
    "3. **Method Scope (Local Variables)**\n",
    "4. **Block Scope (Local Variables in blocks)**\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Class Scope (Static Variables)\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Definition**: Variables declared within a class using the `static` keyword are known as static variables.\n",
    "- **Lifetime**: They are created when the program starts and destroyed when the program terminates.\n",
    "- **Access**: Static variables can be accessed directly using the class name without creating an instance of the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**:\n",
    "```java\n",
    "public class MyClass {\n",
    "    static int staticVar = 10; // Static variable\n",
    "\n",
    "    public static void main(String[] args) {\n",
    "        System.out.println(MyClass.staticVar); // Accessing static variable\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Instance Scope (Instance Variables)\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Definition**: Variables declared within a class but outside any method, and without the `static` keyword, are known as instance variables.\n",
    "- **Lifetime**: They are created when an instance of the class is created and destroyed when the instance is destroyed.\n",
    "- **Access**: Instance variables can be accessed using the object reference.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**:\n",
    "```java\n",
    "public class MyClass {\n",
    "    int instanceVar = 20; // Instance variable\n",
    "\n",
    "    public static void main(String[] args) {\n",
    "        MyClass obj = new MyClass();\n",
    "        System.out.println(obj.instanceVar); // Accessing instance variable\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Method Scope (Local Variables)\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Definition**: Variables declared within a method are known as local variables.\n",
    "- **Lifetime**: They are created when the method is invoked and destroyed when the method exits.\n",
    "- **Access**: Local variables can only be accessed within the method where they are declared.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**:\n",
    "```java\n",
    "public class MyClass {\n",
    "    public void myMethod() {\n",
    "        int localVar = 30; // Local variable\n",
    "        System.out.println(localVar);\n",
    "    }\n",
    "\n",
    "    public static void main(String[] args) {\n",
    "        MyClass obj = new MyClass();\n",
    "        obj.myMethod();\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Block Scope (Local Variables in blocks)\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Definition**: Variables declared within a block of code (such as loops, conditionals, etc.) are known as block-scoped variables.\n",
    "- **Lifetime**: They are created when the block is entered and destroyed when the block is exited.\n",
    "- **Access**: Block-scoped variables can only be accessed within the block where they are declared.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**:\n",
    "```java\n",
    "public class MyClass {\n",
    "    public static void main(String[] args) {\n",
    "        for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) { // i is block-scoped\n",
    "            System.out.println(i);\n",
    "        }\n",
    "        // System.out.println(i); // This would cause a compile-time error\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Shadowing\n",
    "\n",
    "Shadowing occurs when a local variable in a method or block has the same name as an instance variable. The local variable \"shadows\" the instance variable within its scope.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**:\n",
    "```java\n",
    "public class MyClass {\n",
    "    int x = 10; // Instance variable\n",
    "\n",
    "    public void myMethod() {\n",
    "        int x = 20; // Local variable shadows instance variable\n",
    "        System.out.println(x); // Prints local variable (20)\n",
    "    }\n",
    "\n",
    "    public static void main(String[] args) {\n",
    "        MyClass obj = new MyClass();\n",
    "        obj.myMethod();\n",
    "        System.out.println(obj.x); // Prints instance variable (10)\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Variable Initialization\n",
    "\n",
    "Variables in Java must be initialized before use. The scope of a variable also dictates its initialization.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Static Variables**: Initialized when the class is loaded.\n",
    "- **Instance Variables**: Initialized when an instance of the class is created.\n",
    "- **Local Variables**: Must be explicitly initialized before use, as they do not get a default value.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**:\n",
    "```java\n",
    "public class MyClass {\n",
    "    static int staticVar; // Default initialized to 0\n",
    "    int instanceVar; // Default initialized to 0\n",
    "\n",
    "    public void myMethod() {\n",
    "        int localVar;\n",
    "        // System.out.println(localVar); // Compile-time error: localVar might not have been initialized\n",
    "    }\n",
    "\n",
    "    public static void main(String[] args) {\n",
    "        MyClass obj = new MyClass();\n",
    "        System.out.println(staticVar); // Prints 0\n",
    "        System.out.println(obj.instanceVar); // Prints 0\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Variable Scope and Access Modifiers\n",
    "\n",
    "Access modifiers (`public`, `protected`, `private`, and default) control the visibility of variables beyond their scope.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Public**: Accessible from any other class.\n",
    "- **Protected**: Accessible within the same package and subclasses.\n",
    "- **Private**: Accessible only within the same class.\n",
    "- **Default (no modifier)**: Accessible within the same package.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**:\n",
    "```java\n",
    "public class MyClass {\n",
    "    public int publicVar = 10;\n",
    "    protected int protectedVar = 20;\n",
    "    private int privateVar = 30;\n",
    "    int defaultVar = 40;\n",
    "\n",
    "    public static void main(String[] args) {\n",
    "        MyClass obj = new MyClass();\n",
    "        System.out.println(obj.publicVar); // Accessible\n",
    "        System.out.println(obj.protectedVar); // Accessible\n",
    "        System.out.println(obj.privateVar); // Accessible\n",
    "        System.out.println(obj.defaultVar); // Accessible\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Best Practices\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Minimize Variable Scope**: Declare variables in the narrowest scope possible to reduce errors and improve readability.\n",
    "2. **Use Meaningful Names**: Use descriptive names for variables to make code more understandable.\n",
    "3. **Initialize Variables**: Always initialize variables before use to avoid unexpected behavior.\n",
    "4. **Avoid Shadowing**: Use different names for variables in different scopes to avoid confusion.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding the scope of variables in Java is fundamental for effective programming. It helps in managing memory, avoiding errors, and writing clean and maintainable code. By following best practices and understanding the scope rules, you can make the most of variable scopes in your Java programs.\n",

    "\n",
    "### 2.1 Using Constructors (Deprecated since Java 9)\n",
    "\n",
    "```java\n",
    "Integer intObj = new Integer(5);\n",
    "Double doubleObj = new Double(5.5);\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.2 Using Static Factory Methods (Preferred method)\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.3 Autoboxing (Automatic conversion from primitive to wrapper)\n",
    "\n",
    "```java\n",
    "Integer intObj = 5; // Automatically boxes int to Integer\n",
    "Double doubleObj = 5.5; // Automatically boxes double to Double\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Unboxing Wrapper Objects\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.1 Using Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "```java\n",
    "int primitiveInt = intObj.intValue();\n",
    "double primitiveDouble = doubleObj.doubleValue();\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.2 Autounboxing (Automatic conversion from wrapper to primitive)\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. Utility Methods in Wrapper Classes\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4.1 Parsing Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "```java\n",
    "int parsedInt = Integer.parseInt(\"123\");\n",
    "double parsedDouble = Double.parseDouble(\"123.45\");\n",
    "boolean parsedBoolean = Boolean.parseBoolean(\"true\");\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4.2 toString() Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "```java\n",
    "String intString = Integer.toString(123);\n",
    "String doubleString = Double.toString(123.45);\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4.3 Value Range Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "```java\n",
    "int maxInt = Integer.MAX_VALUE;\n",
    "int minInt = Integer.MIN_VALUE;\n",
    "double maxDouble = Double.MAX_VALUE;\n",
    "double minDouble = Double.MIN_VALUE;\n",

    "int comparisonResult = Integer.compare(5, 10);\n",
    "boolean isEqual = Double.equals(5.5, 5.5);\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5. Wrapper Classes in Collections\n",
    "\n",
    "Java collections can only store objects, not primitives. Wrapper classes allow primitives to be used in collections.\n",
    "\n",
    "```java\n",
    "List<Integer> intList = new ArrayList<>();\n",
    "intList.add(5); // Autoboxing occurs\n",
    "int firstElement = intList.get(0); // Autounboxing occurs\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## 6. Immutability of Wrapper Objects\n",
    "\n",
    "Wrapper objects are immutable, meaning their state cannot be changed after creation.\n",
    "\n",
    "```java\n",
    "Integer x = 5;\n",
    "x = x + 1; // This creates a new Integer object, rather than modifying the existing one\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## 7. Caching in Wrapper Classes\n",
    "\n",
    "Some wrapper classes (Boolean, Byte, Character ≤ 127, Short and Integer between -128 and 127) cache commonly used values for better performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "```java\n",
    "Integer a = 100;\n",
    "Integer b = 100;\n",
    "System.out.println(a == b); // true, due to caching\n",
    "\n",
    "Integer c = 1000;\n",
    "Integer d = 1000;\n",
    "System.out.println(c == d); // false, outside cache range\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## 8. Wrapper Classes and Null\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike primitives, wrapper objects can be null.\n",
    "\n",
    "```java\n",
    "Integer nullableInt = null;\n",
    "int primitiveInt = 0; // Can't be null\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## 9. Performance Considerations\n",
    "\n",
    "- Wrapper classes introduce overhead due to object creation and method calls\n",
    "- Excessive boxing and unboxing can impact performance in critical sections of code\n",
    "\n",
    "## 10. Best Practices\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use primitives for simple variables, parameters, and return types\n",
    "- Use wrapper classes when working with collections or when null values are needed\n",
    "- Prefer static factory methods (valueOf()) over constructors\n",
    "- Be aware of autoboxing and unboxing to avoid unexpected behavior\n",
    "\n",
    "## 11. Wrapper Classes in Generics\n",
    "\n",
    "Wrapper classes are often used with generic types, as generics don't work with primitives.\n",
    "\n",
    "```java\n",
    "public class GenericExample<T> {\n",
    "    private T value;\n",
    "    \n",
    "    public void setValue(T value) {\n",
    "        this.value = value;\n",
    "    }\n",
    "    \n",
    "    public T getValue() {\n",
    "        return value;\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "GenericExample<Integer> intExample = new GenericExample<>();\n",
    "intExample.setValue(5); // Autoboxing occurs\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## 12. Converting Between Wrapper Types\n",
    "\n",
    "Wrapper classes provide methods to convert between different numeric types.\n",
    "\n",
    "```java\n",
    "Double doubleObj = 5.5;\n",
    "Integer intObj = doubleObj.intValue(); // Converts to int, then boxes to Integer\n",
    "Long longObj = doubleObj.longValue(); // Converts to long, then boxes to Long\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## 13. Wrapper Classes and Operators\n",
    "\n",
    "When using operators with wrapper objects, auto-unboxing occurs.\n",
    "\n",
    "```java\n",
    "Integer a = 5;\n",
    "Integer b = 10;\n",
    "Integer sum = a + b; // Auto-unboxing, addition, then auto-boxing\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 14. Wrapper Classes and Operators\n",
    "\n",
    "When using operators with wrapper objects, auto-unboxing occurs.\n",
    "\n",
    "```java\n",
    "Integer a = 5;\n",
    "Integer b = 10;\n",
    "Integer sum = a + b; // Auto-unboxing, addition, then auto-boxing\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This process involves:\n",
    "1. Auto-unboxing of `a` and `b` to their primitive `int` values\n",
    "2. Performing the addition on the primitive values\n",
    "3. Auto-boxing the result back into an `Integer` object\n",
    "\n",
    "It's important to note that this can lead to unexpected behavior or performance issues if overused, especially in loops or other performance-critical sections of code.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 15. Wrapper Classes in Multi-threading\n",
    "\n",
    "Because wrapper objects are immutable, they are inherently thread-safe and can be safely shared between multiple threads without additional synchronization.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key points about wrapper classes in multi-threaded environments:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Immutability**: Once created, a wrapper object's value cannot be changed. This eliminates the risk of one thread modifying the object while another is reading it.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Thread-safety**: Due to their immutability, wrapper objects can be safely shared across threads without the need for explicit synchronization mechanisms.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Atomic operations**: Some wrapper classes provide atomic operations. For example, `AtomicInteger` and `AtomicLong` classes (while not strictly wrapper classes) provide thread-safe operations on their wrapped values.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Usage in concurrent collections**: Wrapper classes are often used as keys in concurrent collections (like `ConcurrentHashMap`) because their immutability ensures that the hash code doesn't change, which is crucial for maintaining the integrity of the collection.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Performance considerations**: While wrapper classes are thread-safe, excessive use of autoboxing and unboxing in multi-threaded environments can still lead to performance issues. In highly concurrent scenarios with frequent updates, consider using specialized classes like `AtomicInteger` instead.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example of using `AtomicInteger` for thread-safe operations:\n",
    "\n",
    "```java\n",
    "import java.util.concurrent.atomic.AtomicInteger;\n",
    "\n",
    "public class ThreadSafeCounter {\n",
    "    private AtomicInteger count = new AtomicInteger(0);\n",
    "\n",
    "    public void increment() {\n",
    "        count.incrementAndGet();\n",
    "    }\n",
    "\n",
    "    public int getCount() {\n",
    "        return count.get();\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, multiple threads can safely call `increment()` concurrently without the risk of lost updates or the need for explicit synchronization.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 16. Wrapper Classes and Memory Usage\n",
    "\n",
    "Wrapper classes consume more memory than their primitive counterparts:\n",
    "\n",
    "- A boolean primitive uses 1 bit, while a Boolean object uses 128 bits (on a 32-bit JVM)\n",
    "- An int primitive uses 32 bits, while an Integer object uses 128 bits (on a 32-bit JVM)\n",
    "\n",
    "This increased memory usage is due to the object overhead and should be considered when working with large datasets or memory-constrained environments.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 17. Wrapper Classes in Reflection\n",
    "\n",
    "Wrapper classes play a crucial role in Java's reflection API:\n",
    "\n",
    "```java\n",
    "Method method = MyClass.class.getMethod(\"myMethod\", Integer.class, Double.class);\n",
    "method.invoke(myObject, 5, 3.14); // Autoboxing occurs here\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "When using reflection, wrapper classes are used to represent the types of method parameters and return values.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 18. Wrapper Classes and Serialization\n",
    "\n",
    "All wrapper classes implement the `Serializable` interface, making them suitable for use in object serialization:\n",
    "\n",
    "```java\n",
    "ObjectOutputStream out = new ObjectOutputStream(new FileOutputStream(\"data.ser\"));\n",
    "out.writeObject(Integer.valueOf(42));\n",
    "out.close();\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This feature is particularly useful when working with distributed systems or when persisting object states.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 19. Wrapper Classes in Java 8+ Functional Interfaces\n",
    "\n",
    "Wrapper classes are extensively used in Java 8+ functional programming features:\n",
    "\n",
    "```java\n",
    "List<Integer> numbers = Arrays.asList(1, 2, 3, 4, 5);\n",
    "int sum = numbers.stream()\n",
    "                 .mapToInt(Integer::intValue)\n",
    "                 .sum();\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Many functional interfaces in the `java.util.function` package use wrapper classes as type parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 20. Wrapper Classes and Garbage Collection\n",
    "\n",
    "Wrapper objects, like all objects in Java, are subject to garbage collection. However, the cached instances (like small Integer values) are not typically garbage collected as they are held in static fields.\n",
    "\n",
    "```java\n",
    "Integer i = 42;  // Uses cached value\n",
    "i = null;        // The 42 object remains in cache, not garbage collected\n",
    "i = 42;          // Reuses the cached value\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding this can be important for memory management in long-running applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 21. Wrapper Classes in APIs and Frameworks\n",
    "\n",
    "Many Java APIs and frameworks use wrapper classes extensively:\n",
    "\n",
    "- JDBC API uses wrapper classes for handling NULL values in databases\n",
    "- Hibernate and other ORMs use wrapper classes for mapping database columns to Java objects\n",
    "- Spring Framework often uses wrapper classes in its data binding and validation mechanisms\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, in JDBC:\n",
    "\n",
    "```java\n",
    "ResultSet rs = statement.executeQuery(\"SELECT age FROM users WHERE id = 1\");\n",
    "if (rs.next()) {\n",
    "    Integer age = rs.getObject(\"age\", Integer.class);  // Returns null if the database value is NULL\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding how wrapper classes are used in these contexts can be crucial for effective Java development.\n",
