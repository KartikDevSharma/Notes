## **Introduction to PyTorch**  

PyTorch is an **open-source deep learning framework** developed by **Facebookâ€™s AI Research Lab (FAIR)**. It is widely used for **machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL)** because of its flexibility, ease of use, and dynamic computational graphs. PyTorch is especially popular in research and production environments due to its **Pythonic** nature and **strong GPU support**.

### **Why PyTorch?**
PyTorch is popular among AI engineers and researchers because:
- ðŸ”¹ **Easy to Learn & Use** â€“ Feels like regular Python with NumPy-like operations.
- ðŸ”¹ **Dynamic Computation Graphs** â€“ More flexibility compared to TensorFlow (before TF 2.0).
- ðŸ”¹ **Strong GPU Acceleration** â€“ Can switch between CPU & GPU seamlessly.
- ðŸ”¹ **Extensive Community Support** â€“ Backed by Facebook and used in major AI projects.
- ðŸ”¹ **Used in Research & Industry** â€“ Many academic papers and AI startups use PyTorch.

### **Key Features of PyTorch**
1. **Tensors** â€“ The core data structure in PyTorch, similar to NumPy arrays but optimized for GPUs.
2. **Autograd (Automatic Differentiation)** â€“ Handles gradients automatically for backpropagation.
3. **Torch.nn** â€“ A module for building neural networks easily.
4. **Torch.optim** â€“ Optimizers like SGD, Adam, etc., for training models efficiently.
5. **Torchvision** â€“ A library with pre-trained models, datasets, and image-processing tools.
6. **Torch.utils.data** â€“ Helps manage and load datasets for training.
7. **Dynamic Computation Graphs** â€“ Graphs are built and modified on the fly, unlike static graphs in TensorFlow 1.x.
8. **Interoperability with NumPy** â€“ Easy conversion between PyTorch tensors and NumPy arrays.

### **Basic Workflow in PyTorch**
To understand how PyTorch works, letâ€™s look at the typical workflow for training a deep learning model:
1. **Load Data** â€“ Use `torch.utils.data` to load datasets.
2. **Define Model** â€“ Build a neural network using `torch.nn.Module`.
3. **Choose Loss Function** â€“ Select a loss function like `nn.CrossEntropyLoss()`.
4. **Pick an Optimizer** â€“ Use optimizers like `torch.optim.Adam()`.
5. **Train the Model** â€“ Loop through epochs, compute loss, and update weights using backpropagation.
6. **Evaluate & Save** â€“ Test the model on unseen data and save the trained model.

### **Code Example: Basic PyTorch Workflow**
```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim

# Step 1: Define a simple neural network
class SimpleNN(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super(SimpleNN, self).__init__()
        self.fc1 = nn.Linear(2, 2)  # Input: 2 neurons, Output: 2 neurons

    def forward(self, x):
        return self.fc1(x)

# Step 2: Create model instance
model = SimpleNN()

# Step 3: Define loss function & optimizer
criterion = nn.MSELoss()  # Mean Squared Error Loss
optimizer = optim.SGD(model.parameters(), lr=0.01)  # Stochastic Gradient Descent

# Step 4: Sample data
x = torch.tensor([[1.0, 2.0]])
y = torch.tensor([[2.0, 3.0]])

# Step 5: Training Step
optimizer.zero_grad()  # Reset gradients
output = model(x)  # Forward pass
loss = criterion(output, y)  # Compute loss
loss.backward()  # Backpropagation
optimizer.step()  # Update weights

print(f"Loss: {loss.item()}")
```
