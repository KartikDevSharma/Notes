    "### Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in JavaScript\n",
    "\n",
    "Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of objects. These objects can contain data, in the form of fields (often known as attributes or properties), and code, in the form of procedures (often known as methods).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Key Concepts of OOP\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Class**:\n",
    "   - A blueprint for creating objects.\n",
    "   - Defines a datatype by bundling data and methods that work on the data into one single unit.\n",
    "   - In JavaScript, classes were introduced in ES6.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```javascript\n",
    "   class Car {\n",
    "       constructor(brand, model) {\n",
    "           this.brand = brand;\n",
    "           this.model = model;\n",
    "       }\n",
    "\n",
    "       displayInfo() {\n",
    "           return `${this.brand} ${this.model}`;\n",
    "       }\n",
    "   }\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Object**:\n",
    "   - An instance of a class.\n",
    "   - Represents a real-world entity with state and behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```javascript\n",
    "   const myCar = new Car('Toyota', 'Corolla');\n",
    "   console.log(myCar.displayInfo());  // Output: Toyota Corolla\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Encapsulation**:\n",
    "   - Bundling the data (attributes) and the methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit or class.\n",
    "   - Restricting direct access to some of the object's components, which can prevent the accidental modification of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```javascript\n",
    "   class Person {\n",
    "       constructor(name, age) {\n",
    "           this.name = name;\n",
    "           let _age = age;  // Private variable\n",
    "\n",
    "           this.getAge = () => _age;\n",
    "           this.setAge = (newAge) => {\n",
    "               if(newAge > 0) {\n",
    "                   _age = newAge;\n",
    "               }\n",
    "           };\n",
    "       }\n",
    "   }\n",
    "\n",
    "   const person1 = new Person('Alice', 30);\n",
    "   console.log(person1.getAge()); // Output: 30\n",
    "   person1.setAge(35);\n",
    "   console.log(person1.getAge()); // Output: 35\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Inheritance**:\n",
    "   - Mechanism to create a new class using the existing class.\n",
    "   - The new class inherits the properties and methods of the existing class.\n",
    "   - Promotes code reusability.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```javascript\n",
    "   class Animal {\n",
    "       constructor(name) {\n",
    "           this.name = name;\n",
    "       }\n",
    "\n",
    "       speak() {\n",
    "           console.log(`${this.name} makes a sound.`);\n",
    "       }\n",
    "   }\n",
    "\n",
    "   class Dog extends Animal {\n",
    "       speak() {\n",
    "           console.log(`${this.name} barks.`);\n",
    "       }\n",
    "   }\n",
    "\n",
    "   const myDog = new Dog('Rex');\n",
    "   myDog.speak();  // Output: Rex barks.\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Polymorphism**:\n",
    "   - The ability to use a common interface for multiple forms (data types).\n",
    "   - In OOP, it allows methods to do different things based on the object it is acting upon.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```javascript\n",
    "   class Shape {\n",
    "       constructor(name) {\n",
    "           this.name = name;\n",
    "       }\n",
    "\n",
    "       draw() {\n",
    "           console.log(`Drawing ${this.name}`);\n",
    "       }\n",
    "   }\n",
    "\n",
    "   class Circle extends Shape {\n",
    "       draw() {\n",
    "           console.log('Drawing a circle');\n",
    "       }\n",
    "   }\n",
    "\n",
    "   class Square extends Shape {\n",
    "       draw() {\n",
    "           console.log('Drawing a square');\n",
    "       }\n",
    "   }\n",
    "\n",
    "   const shapes = [new Circle('circle'), new Square('square')];\n",
    "   shapes.forEach(shape => shape.draw());\n",
    "   // Output: \n",
    "   // Drawing a circle\n",
    "   // Drawing a square\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Abstraction**:\n",
    "   - Hiding the complex implementation details and showing only the necessary features of the object.\n",
    "   - Helps in reducing programming complexity and effort.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```javascript\n",
    "   class CoffeeMachine {\n",
    "       _makeCoffee() {\n",
    "           console.log('Brewing coffee...');\n",
    "       }\n",
    "\n",
    "       makeEspresso() {\n",
    "           this._makeCoffee();\n",
    "           console.log('Espresso is ready!');\n",
    "       }\n",
    "   }\n",
    "\n",
    "   const myMachine = new CoffeeMachine();\n",
    "   myMachine.makeEspresso();  // Output: Brewing coffee... Espresso is ready!\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Advantages of OOP\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Modularity**: The source code for a class can be written and maintained independently of the source code for other classes.\n",
    "- **Reusability**: Classes can be reused across multiple programs.\n",
    "- **Pluggability and Debugging Ease**: If a particular object turns out to be problematic, you can simply remove it from your application and plug in a different object as its replacement.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### JavaScript and OOP\n",
    "\n",
    "JavaScript is a prototype-based language, meaning it doesn't have classes in the same way as other OOP languages like Java or C#. Instead, objects in JavaScript can be created from other objects directly. However, with the introduction of ES6, JavaScript now has a class syntax which makes it easier to implement OOP concepts.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Example of Prototypal Inheritance in JavaScript\n",
    "\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "function Animal(name) {\n",
    "    this.name = name;\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "Animal.prototype.speak = function() {\n",
    "    console.log(`${this.name} makes a sound.`);\n",
    "};\n",
    "\n",
    "function Dog(name) {\n",
    "    Animal.call(this, name);  // Call the parent constructor\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "Dog.prototype = Object.create(Animal.prototype);\n",
    "Dog.prototype.constructor = Dog;\n",
    "\n",
    "Dog.prototype.speak = function() {\n",
    "    console.log(`${this.name} barks.`);\n",
    "};\n",
    "\n",
    "const myDog = new Dog('Rex');\n",
    "myDog.speak();  // Output: Rex barks.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "- **OOP** is a programming paradigm centered around objects rather than actions.\n",
    "- **JavaScript** supports OOP through prototypes and, since ES6, through classes.\n",
    "- Key concepts include **Classes**, **Objects**, **Encapsulation**, **Inheritance**, **Polymorphism**, and **Abstraction**.\n",
    "- Understanding these concepts helps in writing more modular, reusable, and maintainable code.\n",
    "\n",
    "OOP in JavaScript provides a structured and clear way to manage and manipulate objects, making code more intuitive and easier to debug. As you become more familiar with OOP concepts and JavaScript syntax, you'll be able to harness the full potential of OOP in your projects.\n",

    "### Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in JavaScript\n",
    "\n",
    "Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a paradigm centered around objects that represent real-world entities. JavaScript, although originally a prototype-based language, supports OOP principles both through prototypes and ES6 classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Key Concepts in OOP\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Class**:\n",
    "   - A blueprint for creating objects (instances).\n",
    "   - Defines properties and methods that objects created from the class will have.\n",
    "   - Introduced in ES6 to simplify object creation.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```javascript\n",
    "   class Person {\n",
    "       constructor(name, age) {\n",
    "           this.name = name;\n",
    "           this.age = age;\n",
    "       }\n",
    "\n",
    "       greet() {\n",
    "           return `Hello, my name is ${this.name} and I am ${this.age} years old.`;\n",
    "       }\n",
    "   }\n",
    "\n",
    "   const john = new Person('John', 30);\n",
    "   console.log(john.greet());  // Output: Hello, my name is John and I am 30 years old.\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Object**:\n",
    "   - An instance of a class.\n",
    "   - Contains data and functions related to that data.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```javascript\n",
    "   const jane = new Person('Jane', 25);\n",
    "   console.log(jane.greet());  // Output: Hello, my name is Jane and I am 25 years old.\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Encapsulation**:\n",
    "   - Combining data and methods that operate on that data into a single unit (class).\n",
    "   - Access modifiers (private, protected, public) to restrict access to certain components.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```javascript\n",
    "   class User {\n",
    "       constructor(username, password) {\n",
    "           this.username = username;\n",
    "           let _password = password;  // Private variable\n",
    "\n",
    "           this.getPassword = () => _password;\n",
    "           this.setPassword = (newPassword) => {\n",
    "               _password = newPassword;\n",
    "           };\n",
    "       }\n",
    "   }\n",
    "\n",
    "   const user1 = new User('user1', 'password123');\n",
    "   console.log(user1.getPassword()); // Output: password123\n",
    "   user1.setPassword('newPassword456');\n",
    "   console.log(user1.getPassword()); // Output: newPassword456\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Inheritance**:\n",
    "   - Mechanism by which one class (child class) inherits the properties and methods of another class (parent class).\n",
    "   - Promotes code reuse and logical hierarchy.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```javascript\n",
    "   class Animal {\n",
    "       constructor(name) {\n",
    "           this.name = name;\n",
    "       }\n",
    "\n",
    "       speak() {\n",
    "           console.log(`${this.name} makes a sound.`);\n",
    "       }\n",
    "   }\n",
    "\n",
    "   class Dog extends Animal {\n",
    "       speak() {\n",
    "           console.log(`${this.name} barks.`);\n",
    "       }\n",
    "   }\n",
    "\n",
    "   const myDog = new Dog('Rex');\n",
    "   myDog.speak();  // Output: Rex barks.\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Polymorphism**:\n",
    "   - Ability of different classes to be treated as instances of the same class through inheritance.\n",
    "   - A method can behave differently based on the object it is called upon.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```javascript\n",
    "   class Shape {\n",
    "       constructor(name) {\n",
    "           this.name = name;\n",
    "       }\n",
    "\n",
    "       draw() {\n",
    "           console.log(`Drawing ${this.name}`);\n",
    "       }\n",
    "   }\n",
    "\n",
    "   class Circle extends Shape {\n",
    "       draw() {\n",
    "           console.log('Drawing a circle');\n",
    "       }\n",
    "   }\n",
    "\n",
    "   class Square extends Shape {\n",
    "       draw() {\n",
    "           console.log('Drawing a square');\n",
    "       }\n",
    "   }\n",
    "\n",
    "   const shapes = [new Circle('Circle'), new Square('Square')];\n",
    "   shapes.forEach(shape => shape.draw());\n",
    "   // Output:\n",
    "   // Drawing a circle\n",
    "   // Drawing a square\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Abstraction**:\n",
    "   - Hiding the complex implementation details and showing only the necessary features of the object.\n",
    "   - Simplifies interaction with objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```javascript\n",
    "   class CoffeeMachine {\n",
    "       _brewCoffee() {\n",
    "           console.log('Brewing coffee...');\n",
    "       }\n",
    "\n",
    "       makeEspresso() {\n",
    "           this._brewCoffee();\n",
    "           console.log('Espresso is ready!');\n",
    "       }\n",
    "   }\n",
    "\n",
    "   const myMachine = new CoffeeMachine();\n",
    "   myMachine.makeEspresso();  // Output: Brewing coffee... Espresso is ready!\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### JavaScript-Specific OOP Features\n",
    "\n",
    "JavaScript's OOP capabilities can be implemented using prototypes or the ES6 class syntax.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Prototypal Inheritance\n",
    "\n",
    "JavaScript uses prototypal inheritance, where objects inherit properties directly from other objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "function Vehicle(type) {\n",
    "    this.type = type;\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "Vehicle.prototype.getType = function() {\n",
    "    return this.type;\n",
    "};\n",
    "\n",
    "function Car(type, brand) {\n",
    "    Vehicle.call(this, type);\n",
    "    this.brand = brand;\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "Car.prototype = Object.create(Vehicle.prototype);\n",
    "Car.prototype.constructor = Car;\n",
    "\n",
    "Car.prototype.getBrand = function() {\n",
    "    return this.brand;\n",
    "};\n",
    "\n",
    "const myCar = new Car('Car', 'Toyota');\n",
    "console.log(myCar.getType());  // Output: Car\n",
    "console.log(myCar.getBrand()); // Output: Toyota\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "##### ES6 Classes\n",
    "\n",
    "ES6 introduced a new class syntax, which is syntactic sugar over JavaScript's existing prototype-based inheritance.\n",
    "\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "class Vehicle {\n",
    "    constructor(type) {\n",
    "        this.type = type;\n",
    "    }\n",
    "\n",
    "    getType() {\n",
    "        return this.type;\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "class Car extends Vehicle {\n",
    "    constructor(type, brand) {\n",
    "        super(type);\n",
    "        this.brand = brand;\n",
    "    }\n",
    "\n",
    "    getBrand() {\n",
    "        return this.brand;\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "const myCar = new Car('Car', 'Toyota');\n",
    "console.log(myCar.getType());  // Output: Car\n",
    "console.log(myCar.getBrand()); // Output: Toyota\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Practical Examples\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Managing a Library System**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```javascript\n",
    "   class Book {\n",

    "       }\n",
    "\n",
    "       getDetails() {\n",
    "           return `${this.title} by ${this.author}`;\n",

    "   library.addBook(book1);\n",
    "   library.addBook(book2);\n",
    "   console.log(library.listBooks());\n",
    "   // Output: ['1984 by George Orwell', 'To Kill a Mockingbird by Harper Lee']\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **User Authentication System**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```javascript\n",

    "           super(username, password);\n",
    "           this.role = 'admin';\n",
    "       }\n",
    "\n",
    "       changePassword(newPassword) {\n",
    "           this.password = newPassword;\n",
    "       }\n",
    "   }\n",
    "\n",
    "   const admin = new Admin('adminUser', 'adminPass');\n",
    "   console.log(admin.authenticate('adminPass')); // Output: true\n",
    "   admin.changePassword('newAdminPass');\n",

    "### Constructor Functions and the `new` Operator in JavaScript\n",
    "\n",
    "In JavaScript, constructor functions and the `new` operator are fundamental to creating and managing objects. This allows you to define templates for creating multiple objects with the same properties and methods.\n",

    "        console.log(`Hello, my name is ${this.name} and I am ${this.age} years old.`);\n",
    "    };\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In the example above:\n",
    "- `this` refers to the new object being created.\n",
    "- Properties (`name` and `age`) and methods (`greet`) are defined on the new object.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Creating Objects with a Constructor Function\n",
    "\n",
    "The `new` operator is used to create an instance of an object from a constructor function.\n",
    "\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "const john = new Person('John', 30);\n",
    "const jane = new Person('Jane', 25);\n",
    "\n",
    "john.greet();  // Output: Hello, my name is John and I am 30 years old.\n",
    "jane.greet();  // Output: Hello, my name is Jane and I am 25 years old.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "When `new` is used:\n",
    "1. A new empty object is created.\n",
    "2. The `this` keyword inside the constructor function refers to this new object.\n",
    "3. The new object is linked to the constructor function's prototype.\n",
    "4. The constructor function executes, initializing the object.\n",
    "5. The new object is returned.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The `new` Operator\n",
    "\n",
    "The `new` operator is essential for creating instances from constructor functions. It ensures that the constructor function behaves as expected by setting up the prototype chain and binding `this` correctly.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Step-by-Step Process of the `new` Operator\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Create a new empty object**: `let obj = {};`\n",
    "2. **Set the prototype**: The new object's prototype is set to the constructor function's prototype.\n",
    "   ```javascript\n",
    "   obj.__proto__ = Person.prototype;\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "3. **Bind `this`**: The `this` keyword in the constructor function refers to the new object.\n",
    "4. **Execute the constructor function**: The constructor function is executed with `this` bound to the new object.\n",
    "5. **Return the new object**: If the constructor function doesn't return an object, the new object is returned by default.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Prototypal Inheritance with Constructor Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "JavaScript uses prototypes for inheritance. Objects can inherit properties and methods from other objects via the prototype chain.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Adding Methods to the Prototype\n",
    "\n",
    "To share methods across all instances, you can add them to the constructor function's prototype. This is more memory-efficient than defining methods inside the constructor function.\n",
    "\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "function Person(name, age) {\n",
    "    this.name = name;\n",
    "    this.age = age;\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "Person.prototype.greet = function() {\n",
    "    console.log(`Hello, my name is ${this.name} and I am ${this.age} years old.`);\n",
    "};\n",
    "\n",
    "const john = new Person('John', 30);\n",
    "const jane = new Person('Jane', 25);\n",
    "\n",
    "john.greet();  // Output: Hello, my name is John and I am 30 years old.\n",
    "jane.greet();  // Output: Hello, my name is Jane and I am 25 years old.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Inheriting from Another Constructor Function\n",
    "\n",
    "To create a subclass that inherits from a parent class, you can set up the prototype chain and use the `call` method to call the parent constructor.\n",
    "\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "function Animal(name) {\n",
    "    this.name = name;\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "Animal.prototype.speak = function() {\n",
    "    console.log(`${this.name} makes a sound.`);\n",
    "};\n",
    "\n",
    "function Dog(name, breed) {\n",
    "    Animal.call(this, name);  // Call the parent constructor\n",
    "    this.breed = breed;\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "// Set up inheritance\n",
    "Dog.prototype = Object.create(Animal.prototype);\n",
    "Dog.prototype.constructor = Dog;\n",
    "\n",
    "Dog.prototype.speak = function() {\n",
    "    console.log(`${this.name} barks.`);\n",
    "};\n",
    "\n",
    "const myDog = new Dog('Rex', 'German Shepherd');\n",
    "myDog.speak();  // Output: Rex barks.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Practical Examples\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Creating a User System**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```javascript\n",
    "   function User(username, password) {\n",
    "       this.username = username;\n",
    "       this.password = password;\n",
    "   }\n",
    "\n",
    "   User.prototype.authenticate = function(inputPassword) {\n",
    "       return this.password === inputPassword;\n",
    "   };\n",
    "\n",
    "   const user1 = new User('user1', 'password123');\n",
    "   console.log(user1.authenticate('password123'));  // Output: true\n",
    "   console.log(user1.authenticate('wrongPassword'));  // Output: false\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Managing a Library of Books**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```javascript\n",
    "   function Book(title, author) {\n",
    "       this.title = title;\n",
    "       this.author = author;\n",
    "   }\n",
    "\n",
    "   Book.prototype.getDetails = function() {\n",
    "       return `${this.title} by ${this.author}`;\n",
    "   };\n",
    "\n",
    "   function Library() {\n",
    "       this.books = [];\n",
    "   }\n",
    "\n",
    "   Library.prototype.addBook = function(book) {\n",
    "       this.books.push(book);\n",
    "   };\n",
    "\n",
    "   Library.prototype.listBooks = function() {\n",
    "       return this.books.map(book => book.getDetails());\n",
    "   };\n",
    "\n",
    "   const library = new Library();\n",
    "   const book1 = new Book('1984', 'George Orwell');\n",
    "   const book2 = new Book('To Kill a Mockingbird', 'Harper Lee');\n",
    "   library.addBook(book1);\n",
    "   library.addBook(book2);\n",
    "   console.log(library.listBooks());\n",
    "   // Output: ['1984 by George Orwell', 'To Kill a Mockingbird by Harper Lee']\n",

    "### Prototypes in JavaScript\n",
    "\n",
    "Prototypes are a fundamental feature of JavaScript that allow objects to inherit properties and methods from other objects. This mechanism forms the basis of JavaScript's inheritance model.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Understanding Prototypes\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Prototype Property**:\n",
    "   - Every JavaScript function has a `prototype` property, which is an object.\n",
    "   - This property is not enumerable, meaning it doesn't show up in loops or `Object.keys` methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Prototype Chain**:\n",
    "   - When an object tries to access a property or method, JavaScript first looks at the object itself.\n",
    "   - If the property/method is not found, JavaScript looks at the object's prototype, and so on, until it reaches `Object.prototype`, which is the end of the chain.\n",
    "   - This chain of objects is called the prototype chain.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Creating and Using Prototypes\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Constructor Functions and Prototypes\n",
    "\n",
    "Constructor functions allow you to create multiple instances of objects that share methods via their prototype.\n",
    "\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "function Person(name, age) {\n",
    "    this.name = name;\n",
    "    this.age = age;\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "Person.prototype.greet = function() {\n",
    "    console.log(`Hello, my name is ${this.name} and I am ${this.age} years old.`);\n",
    "};\n",
    "\n",
    "const john = new Person('John', 30);\n",
    "const jane = new Person('Jane', 25);\n",
    "\n",
    "john.greet();  // Output: Hello, my name is John and I am 30 years old.\n",
    "jane.greet();  // Output: Hello, my name is Jane and I am 25 years old.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In the example:\n",
    "- The `greet` method is defined on `Person.prototype`.\n",
    "- All instances of `Person` have access to `greet` through the prototype chain.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Prototypal Inheritance\n",
    "\n",
    "Objects can directly inherit from other objects using `Object.create`.\n",
    "\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "const personPrototype = {\n",
    "    greet() {\n",
    "        console.log(`Hello, my name is ${this.name}.`);\n",
    "    }\n",
    "};\n",
    "\n",
    "const john = Object.create(personPrototype);\n",
    "john.name = 'John';\n",
    "john.greet();  // Output: Hello, my name is John.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here:\n",
    "- `john` is created with `personPrototype` as its prototype.\n",
    "- `greet` is available on `john` through the prototype chain.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The `__proto__` Property\n",
    "\n",
    "Every object in JavaScript has an internal property called `[[Prototype]]` (commonly accessed via `__proto__`), which points to its prototype.\n",
    "\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "const obj = {};\n",
    "console.log(obj.__proto__ === Object.prototype);  // Output: true\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Function Prototype\n",
    "\n",
    "Functions in JavaScript have a `prototype` property, which is an object. This object is used when the function is used as a constructor with the `new` keyword.\n",
    "\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "function Car(brand, model) {\n",
    "    this.brand = brand;\n",
    "    this.model = model;\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "Car.prototype.getDetails = function() {\n",
    "    return `${this.brand} ${this.model}`;\n",
    "};\n",
    "\n",
    "const myCar = new Car('Toyota', 'Corolla');\n",
    "console.log(myCar.getDetails());  // Output: Toyota Corolla\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Modifying Prototypes\n",
    "\n",
    "You can add properties and methods to a constructor function's prototype even after instances have been created.\n",
    "\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "function Animal(name) {\n",
    "    this.name = name;\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "const cat = new Animal('Whiskers');\n",
    "\n",
    "Animal.prototype.speak = function() {\n",
    "    console.log(`${this.name} makes a noise.`);\n",
    "};\n",
    "\n",
    "cat.speak();  // Output: Whiskers makes a noise.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Inheriting from Other Prototypes\n",
    "\n",
    "JavaScript allows one prototype to inherit from another, creating a prototype chain.\n",
    "\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "function Animal(name) {\n",
    "    this.name = name;\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "Animal.prototype.speak = function() {\n",
    "    console.log(`${this.name} makes a noise.`);\n",
    "};\n",
    "\n",
    "function Dog(name, breed) {\n",
    "    Animal.call(this, name);\n",
    "    this.breed = breed;\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "Dog.prototype = Object.create(Animal.prototype);\n",
    "Dog.prototype.constructor = Dog;\n",
    "\n",
    "Dog.prototype.speak = function() {\n",
    "    console.log(`${this.name} barks.`);\n",
    "};\n",
    "\n",
    "const myDog = new Dog('Rex', 'German Shepherd');\n",
    "myDog.speak();  // Output: Rex barks.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here:\n",
    "- `Dog` inherits from `Animal`.\n",
    "- `Dog.prototype` is set to an object created with `Animal.prototype`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Checking and Setting Prototypes\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Checking Prototypes**: You can check if an object inherits from another object using `isPrototypeOf`.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```javascript\n",
    "   console.log(Animal.prototype.isPrototypeOf(myDog));  // Output: true\n",

    "### Prototypal Inheritance and the Prototype Chain in JavaScript\n",
    "\n",
    "Prototypal inheritance is a fundamental concept in JavaScript that allows objects to inherit properties and methods from other objects. This differs from classical inheritance found in many other object-oriented programming languages, which typically involves classes and instances.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Prototypes**: Every JavaScript object has a prototype, which is another object that it inherits properties and methods from.\n",
    "2. **Prototype Chain**: The chain of prototypes is known as the prototype chain, and it allows for property and method lookup to traverse up the chain.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Prototypal Inheritance\n",
    "\n",
    "In prototypal inheritance, objects inherit directly from other objects. This is different from class-based inheritance where instances inherit from classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Example\n",
    "\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "const animal = {\n",
    "    speak() {\n",
    "        console.log('Animal speaks');\n",
    "    }\n",
    "};\n",
    "\n",
    "const dog = Object.create(animal);\n",
    "dog.bark = function() {\n",
    "    console.log('Dog barks');\n",
    "};\n",
    "\n",
    "dog.speak();  // Output: Animal speaks\n",
    "dog.bark();   // Output: Dog barks\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example:\n",
    "- `animal` is the prototype object.\n",
    "- `dog` is an object that inherits from `animal` using `Object.create(animal)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The Prototype Chain\n",
    "\n",
    "When a property or method is accessed on an object, JavaScript looks up the property or method along the prototype chain until it finds it or reaches the end of the chain (i.e., `null`).\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Example\n",
    "\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "const animal = {\n",
    "    eats: true\n",
    "};\n",
    "\n",
    "const rabbit = Object.create(animal);\n",
    "rabbit.jumps = true;\n",
    "\n",
    "console.log(rabbit.jumps);  // true\n",
    "console.log(rabbit.eats);   // true\n",
    "console.log(rabbit.hasOwnProperty('eats'));  // false\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example:\n",
    "- `rabbit` has its own property `jumps`.\n",
    "- `rabbit` inherits the property `eats` from its prototype `animal`.\n",
    "- `hasOwnProperty` checks if `eats` is a direct property of `rabbit` (which it is not).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Object Prototype\n",
    "\n",
    "The prototype of an object created using object literals is `Object.prototype`.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Example\n",
    "\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "const obj = {};\n",
    "console.log(Object.getPrototypeOf(obj) === Object.prototype);  // true\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Constructor Functions and Prototypes\n",
    "\n",
    "Constructor functions are used to create objects and set up their prototypes.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Example\n",
    "\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "function Person(name) {\n",
    "    this.name = name;\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "Person.prototype.greet = function() {\n",
    "    console.log(`Hello, my name is ${this.name}`);\n",
    "};\n",
    "\n",
    "const alice = new Person('Alice');\n",
    "alice.greet();  // Output: Hello, my name is Alice\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example:\n",
    "- `Person` is a constructor function.\n",
    "- `Person.prototype` contains methods that all instances created by `Person` will inherit.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Modifying Prototypes\n",
    "\n",
    "You can add methods or properties to a prototype after an object has been created.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Example\n",
    "\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "function Person(name) {\n",
    "    this.name = name;\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "const bob = new Person('Bob');\n",

    "    console.log(`Hello, my name is ${this.name}`);\n",
    "};\n",
    "\n",
    "bob.greet();  // Output: Hello, my name is Bob\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### `__proto__` and `Object.getPrototypeOf`\n",
    "\n",
    "`__proto__` is a legacy way to access an object's prototype. The recommended way is to use `Object.getPrototypeOf`.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Example\n",
    "\n",

    "const animal = {\n",
    "    eats: true\n",
    "};\n",
    "\n",
    "const rabbit = Object.create(animal);\n",
    "\n",
    "console.log(rabbit.__proto__ === animal);  // true\n",
    "console.log(Object.getPrototypeOf(rabbit) === animal);  // true\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Setting the Prototype\n",
    "\n",
    "You can set the prototype of an object using `Object.setPrototypeOf`.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Example\n",
    "\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "const animal = {\n",
    "    eats: true\n",
    "};\n",
    "\n",
    "const rabbit = {};\n",
    "Object.setPrototypeOf(rabbit, animal);\n",
    "\n",
    "console.log(rabbit.eats);  // true\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The `prototype` Property vs. `__proto__`\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`prototype` Property**:\n",
    "  - Used with constructor functions.\n",
    "  - Specifies the prototype for instances created by the constructor.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`__proto__` Property**:\n",
    "  - References the prototype of an existing object.\n",
    "  - Legacy way to access prototypes (use `Object.getPrototypeOf` instead).\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Example\n",
    "\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "function Person(name) {\n",
    "    this.name = name;\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "console.log(Person.prototype);  // Person { ... }\n",
    "\n",
    "const person = new Person('Alice');\n",
    "console.log(person.__proto__ === Person.prototype);  // true\n",
    "console.log(Object.getPrototypeOf(person) === Person.prototype);  // true\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Inheritance and the Prototype Chain\n",
    "\n",
    "Inheritance allows one object to inherit properties and methods from another object through the prototype chain.\n",

    "### Prototypal Inheritance and Built-in Objects in JavaScript\n",
    "\n",
    "Prototypal inheritance is a fundamental feature of JavaScript, enabling objects to inherit properties and methods from other objects. Understanding how this works and how built-in objects leverage prototypal inheritance is crucial for mastering JavaScript.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Prototypal Inheritance\n",
    "\n",
    "Prototypal inheritance allows one object to inherit properties and methods from another. This is different from classical inheritance in languages like Java, where classes inherit from other classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Basic Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Prototype Chain**:\n",
    "   - Every object in JavaScript has a prototype, which is another object from which it inherits properties and methods.\n",
    "   - The prototype chain is the series of links between objects' prototypes, ending with `Object.prototype`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **`__proto__` Property**:\n",
    "   - An internal property (also accessible via the `__proto__` property) that points to the prototype of the object.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **`prototype` Property**:\n",
    "   - Functions in JavaScript have a `prototype` property that is used when they are used as constructor functions with the `new` keyword.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Example of Prototypal Inheritance\n",
    "\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "function Person(name, age) {\n",
    "    this.name = name;\n",
    "    this.age = age;\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "Person.prototype.greet = function() {\n",
    "    console.log(`Hello, my name is ${this.name} and I am ${this.age} years old.`);\n",
    "};\n",
    "\n",
    "function Employee(name, age, jobTitle) {\n",
    "    Person.call(this, name, age);  // Inherit properties from Person\n",
    "    this.jobTitle = jobTitle;\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "// Inherit methods from Person\n",
    "Employee.prototype = Object.create(Person.prototype);\n",
    "Employee.prototype.constructor = Employee;\n",
    "\n",
    "Employee.prototype.work = function() {\n",
    "    console.log(`${this.name} is working as a ${this.jobTitle}.`);\n",
    "};\n",
    "\n",
    "const john = new Employee('John', 30, 'Software Engineer');\n",
    "john.greet();  // Output: Hello, my name is John and I am 30 years old.\n",
    "john.work();   // Output: John is working as a Software Engineer.\n",

    "### ES6 Classes in JavaScript\n",
    "\n",
    "ECMAScript 2015 (ES6) introduced a new syntax for creating objects and handling inheritance called \"classes.\" Although JavaScript remains a prototype-based language, classes provide a more familiar syntax for those coming from classical OOP languages like Java or C#.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Introduction to ES6 Classes\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Class Declaration**: A class is defined using the `class` keyword.\n",
    "2. **Constructor**: The `constructor` method is a special method for creating and initializing an object created with the `new` keyword.\n",
    "3. **Methods**: Functions defined within a class are methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Basic Class Syntax\n",
    "\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "class Person {\n",
    "    constructor(name, age) {\n",
    "        this.name = name;\n",
    "        this.age = age;\n",
    "    }\n",
    "\n",
    "    greet() {\n",

    "\n",
    "const john = new Person('John', 30);\n",
    "john.greet();  // Output: Hello, my name is John and I am 30 years old.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Class Components\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Constructor Method**:\n",
    "   - The `constructor` method is called when a new instance of the class is created.\n",
    "   - It is used to initialize object properties.\n",
    "\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "class Rectangle {\n",

    "console.log(myRectangle.getPerimeter());   // Output: 60\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Static Methods**:\n",
    "   - Static methods are defined on the class itself, not on instances of the class.\n",
    "   - They are used to create utility functions related to the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "class MathUtil {\n",

    "### Setters and Getters in JavaScript\n",
    "\n",
    "Setters and getters in JavaScript are special methods that allow you to get and set the values of properties in a controlled way. They provide a way to define accessors for properties, enabling encapsulation and control over how properties are accessed and mutated.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Getters**: Methods that get the value of a property.\n",
    "2. **Setters**: Methods that set the value of a property.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Syntax\n",
    "\n",
    "Setters and getters are defined using the `get` and `set` keywords within an object or a class.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Object Literal Syntax\n",
    "\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "const obj = {\n",
    "    _property: 0,  // Convention to use underscore for internal properties\n",
    "\n",
    "    get property() {\n",
    "        return this._property;\n",
    "    },\n",
    "\n",
    "    set property(value) {\n",
    "        if (value >= 0) {\n",
    "            this._property = value;\n",
    "        } else {\n",
    "            console.log('Invalid value');\n",
    "        }\n",
    "    }\n",
    "};\n",
    "\n",
    "console.log(obj.property);  // Output: 0\n",
    "obj.property = 10;\n",
    "console.log(obj.property);  // Output: 10\n",
    "obj.property = -1;  // Output: Invalid value\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Class Syntax\n",
    "\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "class MyClass {\n",
    "    constructor(value) {\n",
    "        this._property = value;\n",
    "    }\n",
    "\n",
    "    get property() {\n",
    "        return this._property;\n",
    "    }\n",
    "\n",
    "    set property(value) {\n",
    "        if (value >= 0) {\n",
    "            this._property = value;\n",
    "        } else {\n",
    "            console.log('Invalid value');\n",

    "console.log(instance.property);  // Output: 10\n",
    "instance.property = -1;  // Output: Invalid value\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Characteristics\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Encapsulation**:\n",
    "   - Getters and setters allow for encapsulation, providing control over how properties are accessed and modified.\n",
    "   - This can be useful for validating data before setting a property or for computing a property dynamically.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Consistency**:\n",
    "   - They help maintain consistency within the codebase by ensuring properties are accessed and mutated in a controlled manner.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Flexibility**:\n",
    "   - Getters and setters can be used to define computed properties, which are properties that are calculated based on other properties.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Practical Examples\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Computed Properties\n",
    "\n",
    "Getters can be used to define properties that are computed based on other properties.\n",
    "\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "class Rectangle {\n",
    "    constructor(width, height) {\n",
    "        this.width = width;\n",
    "        this.height = height;\n",
    "    }\n",
    "\n",
    "    get area() {\n",
    "        return this.width * this.height;\n",
    "    }\n",
    "\n",
    "    get perimeter() {\n",
    "        return 2 * (this.width + this.height);\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "const rect = new Rectangle(10, 20);\n",
    "console.log(rect.area);  // Output: 200\n",
    "console.log(rect.perimeter);  // Output: 60\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Validation\n",
    "\n",
    "Setters can be used to validate data before assigning it to a property.\n",
    "\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "class Person {\n",
    "    constructor(name, age) {\n",
    "        this.name = name;\n",
    "        this.age = age;\n",
    "    }\n",
    "\n",
    "    get age() {\n",
    "        return this._age;\n",
    "    }\n",
    "\n",
    "    set age(value) {\n",
    "        if (value >= 0 && value <= 120) {\n",
    "            this._age = value;\n",
    "        } else {\n",
    "            console.log('Invalid age');\n",
    "        }\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "const person = new Person('Alice', 25);\n",
    "console.log(person.age);  // Output: 25\n",
    "person.age = 30;\n",
    "console.log(person.age);  // Output: 30\n",
    "person.age = -5;  // Output: Invalid age\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Defining Getters and Setters Dynamically\n",
    "\n",
    "You can define getters and setters dynamically using `Object.defineProperty`.\n",
    "\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "const obj = {};\n",
    "let value = 0;\n",
    "\n",
    "Object.defineProperty(obj, 'property', {\n",
    "    get() {\n",
    "        return value;\n",
    "    },\n",
    "    set(newValue) {\n",
    "        if (newValue >= 0) {\n",
    "            value = newValue;\n",
    "        } else {\n",
    "            console.log('Invalid value');\n",
    "        }\n",
    "    }\n",
    "});\n",
    "\n",
    "console.log(obj.property);  // Output: 0\n",
    "obj.property = 10;\n",
    "console.log(obj.property);  // Output: 10\n",
    "obj.property = -1;  // Output: Invalid value\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Private Fields with Getters and Setters\n",
    "\n",
    "With the introduction of private fields (denoted by `#`), getters and setters can interact with private fields.\n",
    "\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "class BankAccount {\n",
    "    #balance = 0;  // Private field\n",
    "\n",
    "    get balance() {\n",
    "        return this.#balance;\n",
    "    }\n",
    "\n",
    "    set balance(amount) {\n",
    "        if (amount >= 0) {\n",
    "            this.#balance = amount;\n",
    "        } else {\n",
    "            console.log('Invalid amount');\n",
    "        }\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "const account = new BankAccount();\n",
    "console.log(account.balance);  // Output: 0\n",
    "account.balance = 100;\n",
    "console.log(account.balance);  // Output: 100\n",
    "account.balance = -50;  // Output: Invalid amount\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Common Use Cases\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Data Validation**:\n",
    "   - Ensure values meet certain criteria before setting them.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Computed Properties**:\n",
    "   - Calculate values on the fly based on other properties.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Encapsulation**:\n",
    "   - Hide internal data and expose only necessary properties.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Interception**:\n",
    "   - Intercept and log property access or modifications.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Best Practices\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Naming Conventions**:\n",
    "   - Use an underscore or other convention to differentiate between internal properties and their public accessors.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Minimal Side Effects**:\n",
    "   - Keep the logic within getters and setters minimal to avoid unexpected side effects.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Use Getters for Computed Values**:\n",
    "   - Use getters to compute values dynamically rather than storing them.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Validation in Setters**:\n",
    "   - Implement validation logic in setters to ensure data integrity.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Getters and Setters**: Special methods to get and set property values.\n",
    "- **Encapsulation**: Provides controlled access to properties.\n",
    "- **Computed Properties**: Define properties computed from other properties.\n",
    "- **Validation**: Validate data before setting it.\n",
    "- **Dynamically Defined Accessors**: Use `Object.defineProperty` for dynamic definition.\n",
    "- **Private Fields**: Use private fields with getters and setters for better encapsulation.\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Practical Use Cases\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Creating Utility Libraries**:\n",
    "   - Static methods are ideal for creating utility libraries or functions that do not need to operate on instance data.\n",

    "### `Object.create` in JavaScript\n",
    "\n",
    "`Object.create` is a method in JavaScript that allows you to create a new object with a specified prototype and properties. This method provides a way to establish prototype-based inheritance more directly and flexibly than using constructor functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Prototype Chain**: `Object.create` sets the prototype of the new object to the specified prototype object.\n",
    "2. **Property Descriptors**: It can also define properties with specific descriptors.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Syntax\n",
    "\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "Object.create(proto, [propertiesObject])\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- `proto`: The object to be used as the prototype of the new object.\n",
    "- `propertiesObject` (optional): An object whose enumerable own properties specify property descriptors to be added to the newly created object.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Basic Usage\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Creating an Object with a Specific Prototype\n",
    "\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "const personPrototype = {\n",
    "    greet() {\n",
    "        console.log(`Hello, my name is ${this.name}`);\n",
    "    }\n",
    "};\n",
    "\n",
    "const person = Object.create(personPrototype);\n",
    "person.name = 'Alice';\n",
    "person.greet();  // Output: Hello, my name is Alice\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example:\n",
    "- `personPrototype` is used as the prototype of the new object `person`.\n",
    "- `person` inherits the `greet` method from `personPrototype`.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Using Property Descriptors\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also define properties with descriptors when creating the object.\n",
    "\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "const personPrototype = {\n",
    "    greet() {\n",
    "        console.log(`Hello, my name is ${this.name}`);\n",
    "    }\n",

    "        value: 'Alice',\n",
    "        writable: true,\n",
    "        enumerable: true,\n",
    "        configurable: true\n",

    "\n",
    "In this example:\n",
    "- `name` is defined with descriptors such as `writable`, `enumerable`, and `configurable`.\n",

    "1. **More Direct Prototype Inheritance**:\n",
    "   - `Object.create` allows you to set up prototype chains more directly than using constructor functions.\n",
    "   \n",
    "2. **Control Over Property Descriptors**:\n",
    "   - It provides a way to define properties with specific descriptors right at object creation.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Avoids Constructor Functions**:\n",
    "   - Useful in scenarios where you don't need to initialize objects using constructors.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Practical Examples\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Classical Inheritance with `Object.create`\n",
    "\n",
    "Using `Object.create`, you can simulate classical inheritance patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "const Animal = {\n",
    "    init(type) {\n",
    "        this.type = type;\n",
    "    },\n",
    "    speak() {\n",
    "        console.log(`${this.type} makes a sound.`);\n",
    "    }\n",
    "};\n",
    "\n",
    "const dog = Object.create(Animal);\n",
    "dog.init('Dog');\n",
    "dog.speak();  // Output: Dog makes a sound.\n",
    "\n",
    "const cat = Object.create(Animal);\n",
    "cat.init('Cat');\n",
    "cat.speak();  // Output: Cat makes a sound.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Creating an Object with Multiple Prototypes\n",
    "\n",
    "You can create objects that inherit from multiple prototypes by combining `Object.create` with mixins.\n",
    "\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "const canWalk = {\n",
    "    walk() {\n",
    "        console.log(`${this.name} is walking.`);\n",
    "    }\n",
    "};\n",
    "\n",
    "const canSwim = {\n",
    "    swim() {\n",
    "        console.log(`${this.name} is swimming.`);\n",
    "    }\n",
    "};\n",
    "\n",
    "const person = Object.create(canWalk);\n",
    "Object.assign(person, canSwim);\n",
    "\n",
    "person.name = 'John';\n",
    "person.walk();  // Output: John is walking.\n",
    "person.swim();  // Output: John is swimming.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Defining Properties with Descriptors\n",
    "\n",
    "Using property descriptors to define properties with specific characteristics.\n",
    "\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "const personPrototype = {\n",
    "    greet() {\n",
    "        console.log(`Hello, my name is ${this.name}`);\n",
    "    }\n",
    "};\n",
    "\n",
    "const person = Object.create(personPrototype, {\n",
    "    name: {\n",
    "        value: 'Alice',\n",
    "        writable: true,\n",
    "        enumerable: true,\n",
    "        configurable: true\n",
    "    },\n",
    "    age: {\n",
    "        value: 30,\n",
    "        writable: false,\n",
    "        enumerable: true,\n",
    "        configurable: true\n",
    "    }\n",
    "});\n",
    "\n",
    "console.log(person.name);  // Output: Alice\n",
    "console.log(person.age);   // Output: 30\n",
    "person.greet();            // Output: Hello, my name is Alice\n",
    "\n",
    "person.age = 35;           // Doesn't change because `age` is not writable\n",
    "console.log(person.age);   // Output: 30\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Understanding Property Descriptors\n",
    "\n",
    "When defining properties using `Object.create`, you can specify property descriptors:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **value**: The value associated with the property (default is `undefined`).\n",
    "2. **writable**: If `true`, the value of the property can be changed (default is `false`).\n",
    "3. **enumerable**: If `true`, the property will be listed during enumeration of the properties on the object (default is `false`).\n",
    "4. **configurable**: If `true`, the type of this property descriptor can be changed, and the property can be deleted from the object (default is `false`).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Using `Object.create` for Prototypal Inheritance\n",
    "\n",
    "`Object.create` is particularly useful for creating objects that need to inherit from other objects, enabling a clear and flexible prototype chain.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Example: Prototypal Inheritance\n",
    "\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "const carPrototype = {\n",
    "    startEngine() {\n",
    "        console.log('Engine started.');\n",
    "    },\n",
    "    stopEngine() {\n",
    "        console.log('Engine stopped.');\n",
    "    }\n",
    "};\n",
    "\n",
    "const electricCar = Object.create(carPrototype, {\n",
    "    chargeBattery: {\n",
    "        value() {\n",
    "            console.log('Battery charged.');\n",
    "        },\n",
    "        writable: false,\n",
    "        enumerable: true,\n",
    "        configurable: true\n",
    "    }\n",
    "});\n",
    "\n",
    "electricCar.startEngine();   // Output: Engine started.\n",
    "electricCar.chargeBattery(); // Output: Battery charged.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Best Practices\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Use `Object.create` for Prototypal Inheritance**:\n",
    "   - Prefer `Object.create` when you need direct and clear prototype chains without the need for constructors.\n",
    "   \n",
    "2. **Property Descriptors**:\n",
    "   - Define properties with specific descriptors when needed for better control over property behavior.\n",
    "   \n",
    "3. **Avoid Overuse**:\n",
    "   - While powerful, use `Object.create` judiciously and understand its implications on prototype chains and property inheritance.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`Object.create` Method**: Creates a new object with a specified prototype and optional property descriptors.\n",
    "- **Prototype Chain**: Establishes prototype-based inheritance directly.\n",
    "- **Property Descriptors**: Allows defining properties with specific characteristics (writable, enumerable, configurable).\n",
    "- **Utility**: Useful for creating objects with well-defined prototype chains and properties.\n",
    "- **Best Practices**: Use for clear inheritance structures and control over property definitions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding `Object.create` and its capabilities allows for more flexible and powerful object-oriented programming in JavaScript, providing a deeper control over object creation and inheritance patterns.\n",

    "### Inheritance Between Classes and Constructor Functions in JavaScript\n",
    "\n",
    "Inheritance in JavaScript can be achieved using both ES6 classes and traditional constructor functions. Understanding how inheritance works in both paradigms is crucial for writing effective and maintainable JavaScript code. This guide will provide comprehensive notes on inheritance using both ES6 classes and constructor functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### ES6 Classes\n",
    "\n",
    "ES6 introduced classes, which provide a more straightforward and syntactically clean way to create objects and handle inheritance compared to constructor functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Defining a Class\n",
    "\n",
    "A class in ES6 is defined using the `class` keyword.\n",
    "\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "class Person {\n",
    "    constructor(name) {\n",
    "        this.name = name;\n",
    "    }\n",
    "\n",
    "    greet() {\n",
    "        console.log(`Hello, my name is ${this.name}`);\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "const alice = new Person('Alice');\n",
    "alice.greet();  // Output: Hello, my name is Alice\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Inheritance Using `extends`\n",
    "\n",
    "To create a subclass that inherits from a superclass, use the `extends` keyword.\n",
    "\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "class Person {\n",
    "    constructor(name) {\n",
    "        this.name = name;\n",
    "    }\n",
    "\n",
    "    greet() {\n",
    "        console.log(`Hello, my name is ${this.name}`);\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "class Student extends Person {\n",
    "    constructor(name, studentId) {\n",
    "        super(name);  // Call the superclass constructor\n",
    "        this.studentId = studentId;\n",
    "    }\n",
    "\n",
    "    study() {\n",
    "        console.log(`${this.name} is studying`);\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "const bob = new Student('Bob', 12345);\n",
    "bob.greet();  // Output: Hello, my name is Bob\n",
    "bob.study();  // Output: Bob is studying\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example:\n",
    "- `Person` is the superclass.\n",
    "- `Student` is the subclass that inherits from `Person`.\n",
    "- The `super` keyword is used to call the superclass constructor from the subclass constructor.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Overriding Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "Subclasses can override methods from the superclass.\n",
    "\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "class Person {\n",
    "    constructor(name) {\n",
    "        this.name = name;\n",
    "    }\n",
    "\n",
    "    greet() {\n",

    "\n",
    "const charlie = new Student('Charlie', 67890);\n",
    "charlie.greet();  \n",
    "// Output: \n",
    "// Hello, my name is Charlie\n",
    "// My student ID is 67890\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, `Student` overrides the `greet` method of `Person`.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Static Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "Static methods are defined on the class itself rather than on instances of the class. They are inherited by subclasses.\n",
    "\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "class Person {\n",
    "    static species() {\n",
    "        return 'Homo sapiens';\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",

    "class Student extends Person {}\n",
    "\n",
    "console.log(Student.species());  // Output: Homo sapiens\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Constructor Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "Before ES6, constructor functions were used to create objects and set up inheritance.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Defining a Constructor Function\n",
    "\n",
    "A constructor function is a regular function used to initialize an object with properties and methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "function Person(name) {\n",
    "    this.name = name;\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "Person.prototype.greet = function() {\n",
    "    console.log(`Hello, my name is ${this.name}`);\n",
    "};\n",
    "\n",
    "const alice = new Person('Alice');\n",
    "alice.greet();  // Output: Hello, my name is Alice\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Inheritance Using Constructor Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "Inheritance is achieved by setting the prototype of the subclass to an instance of the superclass.\n",
    "\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "function Person(name) {\n",
    "    this.name = name;\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "Person.prototype.greet = function() {\n",
    "    console.log(`Hello, my name is ${this.name}`);\n",
    "};\n",
    "\n",
    "function Student(name, studentId) {\n",
    "    Person.call(this, name);  // Call the superclass constructor\n",
    "    this.studentId = studentId;\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "// Set up inheritance\n",
    "Student.prototype = Object.create(Person.prototype);\n",
    "Student.prototype.constructor = Student;\n",
    "\n",
    "Student.prototype.study = function() {\n",
    "    console.log(`${this.name} is studying`);\n",
    "};\n",
    "\n",
    "const bob = new Student('Bob', 12345);\n",
    "bob.greet();  // Output: Hello, my name is Bob\n",
    "bob.study();  // Output: Bob is studying\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example:\n",
    "- `Person` is the superclass constructor function.\n",
    "- `Student` is the subclass constructor function.\n",
    "- `Person.call(this, name)` calls the superclass constructor with the current object context.\n",
    "- `Student.prototype = Object.create(Person.prototype)` sets up the prototype chain.\n",
    "- `Student.prototype.constructor = Student` ensures the `constructor` property points to the `Student` function.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Overriding Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "Subclasses can override methods from the superclass by redefining them on the prototype.\n",
    "\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "function Person(name) {\n",
    "    this.name = name;\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",

    "    this.studentId = studentId;\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "Student.prototype = Object.create(Person.prototype);\n",
    "Student.prototype.constructor = Student;\n",
    "\n",
    "Student.prototype.greet = function() {\n",
    "    Person.prototype.greet.call(this);  // Call the superclass method\n",
    "    console.log(`My student ID is ${this.studentId}`);\n",
    "};\n",
    "\n",
    "const charlie = new Student('Charlie', 67890);\n",
    "charlie.greet();\n",
    "// Output: \n",
    "// Hello, my name is Charlie\n",
    "// My student ID is 67890\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, `Student` overrides the `greet` method of `Person`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Comparison Between ES6 Classes and Constructor Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Syntax**: ES6 classes provide a cleaner and more intuitive syntax for defining and managing inheritance.\n",
    "- **Static Methods**: Easier to define and inherit in ES6 classes.\n",
    "- **`super` Keyword**: ES6 classes use `super` for calling superclass constructors and methods, which is not available in constructor functions.\n",
    "- **Prototypes**: Both ES6 classes and constructor functions ultimately rely on the prototype chain for inheritance.\n",

    "- **Avoid Deep Inheritance Hierarchies**: Keep inheritance hierarchies shallow to maintain code simplicity and readability.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "- **ES6 Classes**:\n",

    "### Inheritance Between ES6 Classes\n",
    "\n",
    "In ES6, classes were introduced as a syntactical sugar over JavaScript's existing prototype-based inheritance. Inheritance between ES6 classes allows for the creation of hierarchical relationships where child classes (subclasses) inherit properties and methods from parent classes (superclasses). This mechanism provides a way to promote code reuse and build more complex and structured applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Basics of Inheritance\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Superclasses and Subclasses**:\n",
    "   - Superclasses are also known as parent or base classes.\n",
    "   - Subclasses are also known as child or derived classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Inheriting Properties and Methods**:\n",
    "   - Subclasses inherit properties and methods from their superclass.\n",
    "   - They can extend or override inherited functionality.\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Super Keyword\n",
    "\n",
    "The `super` keyword is used inside subclass methods to call the superclass constructor or methods.\n",

    "#### Extending Properties\n",
    "\n",
    "Subclasses can extend the properties of their superclass by adding new properties in the constructor.\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Constructor Execution Order\n",
    "\n",
    "When a subclass has its own constructor, it must call `super()` before accessing `this`. The order of execution is important.\n",
    "\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "class Parent {\n",
    "    constructor() {\n",
    "        console.log('Parent constructor');\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "class Child extends Parent {\n",
    "    constructor() {\n",
    "        super(); // Call the superclass constructor first\n",
    "        console.log('Child constructor');\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "const child = new Child();\n",
    "// Output:\n",
    "// Parent constructor\n",
    "// Child constructor\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Static Methods and Inheritance\n",
    "\n",
    "Static methods are also inherited by subclasses, and they can be accessed using the subclass itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "class Parent {\n",
    "    static staticMethod() {\n",
    "        console.log('Static method in Parent');\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "class Child extends Parent {}\n",
    "\n",
    "Child.staticMethod();  // Output: Static method in Parent\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Best Practices\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Use Constructor Properly**:\n",
    "   - Ensure that `super()` is called correctly within the constructor of subclasses.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Follow Naming Conventions**:\n",
    "   - Maintain a clear and consistent naming convention for classes, methods, and properties.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Avoid Deep Inheritance Hierarchies**:\n",
    "   - Prefer composition over deep inheritance hierarchies to keep code modular and maintainable.\n",

    "### Inheritance Between Classes and `Object.create` in JavaScript\n",
    "\n",
    "Inheritance in JavaScript can be achieved in several ways, with ES6 classes and `Object.create` being two of the most prominent methods. Understanding how to use `Object.create` for inheritance, alongside ES6 classes, provides a solid foundation for implementing inheritance in JavaScript.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Inheritance Using `Object.create`\n",
    "\n",
    "`Object.create` is a method that allows you to create a new object with a specified prototype object and properties. This method is often used to set up prototypal inheritance without using constructor functions or classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Creating an Object with a Specific Prototype\n",
    "\n",
    "The `Object.create` method creates a new object, using an existing object as the prototype of the newly created object.\n",
    "\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "const animal = {\n",
    "    speak() {\n",
    "        console.log('Animal speaks');\n",
    "    }\n",
    "};\n",
    "\n",
    "const dog = Object.create(animal);\n",
    "dog.bark = function() {\n",
    "    console.log('Dog barks');\n",
    "};\n",
    "\n",
    "dog.speak();  // Output: Animal speaks\n",
    "dog.bark();   // Output: Dog barks\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example:\n",
    "- `animal` is the prototype object.\n",
    "- `dog` is an object created with `animal` as its prototype.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Using `Object.create` for Inheritance\n",
    "\n",
    "You can create complex inheritance structures by chaining prototypes using `Object.create`.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Example: Basic Inheritance\n",
    "\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "const animal = {\n",
    "    eats: true\n",
    "};\n",
    "\n",
    "const rabbit = Object.create(animal);\n",
    "rabbit.jumps = true;\n",
    "\n",
    "console.log(rabbit.eats);  // true (inherited from animal)\n",
    "console.log(rabbit.jumps); // true (own property)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example:\n",
    "- `rabbit` inherits properties from `animal` using `Object.create`.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Example: Constructor Functions with `Object.create`\n",
    "\n",
    "You can combine constructor functions with `Object.create` to achieve inheritance.\n",
    "\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "function Person(name) {\n",
    "    this.name = name;\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "Person.prototype.greet = function() {\n",
    "    console.log(`Hello, my name is ${this.name}`);\n",
    "};\n",
    "\n",
    "function Student(name, studentId) {\n",
    "    Person.call(this, name);\n",
    "    this.studentId = studentId;\n",
    "}\n",

    "const bob = new Student('Bob', 12345);\n",
    "bob.greet();  // Output: Hello, my name is Bob\n",
    "bob.study();  // Output: Bob is studying\n",
    "```\n",

    "In this example:\n",
    "- `Student` inherits from `Person` using `Object.create` to set up the prototype chain.\n",
    "- `Student.prototype = Object.create(Person.prototype)` sets up the inheritance.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Extending Properties and Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "You can add new properties and methods to the subclass prototype.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "In this example:\n",
    "- `Dog` extends `Animal` and adds a new method `bark`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Prototypal Inheritance vs. Classical Inheritance\n",
    "\n",
    "JavaScript's prototypal inheritance provides flexibility compared to classical inheritance found in other object-oriented languages.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Prototypal Inheritance**:\n",
    "  - Objects inherit directly from other objects.\n",
    "  - More flexible and dynamic.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Classical Inheritance**:\n",

    "  - More rigid and hierarchical.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Using `Object.create` with ES6 Classes\n",
    "\n",
    "Although `Object.create` is commonly used with traditional function constructors, understanding how ES6 classes work with inheritance is also important.\n",

    "### Encapsulation: Protected Properties and Methods in JavaScript\n",
    "\n",
    "Encapsulation is a core concept in object-oriented programming (OOP) that refers to the bundling of data (properties) and methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit, typically a class or object. This also includes restricting direct access to some of an object's components, which can prevent the accidental modification of data and help maintain the integrity of the internal state. Encapsulation is often achieved through access modifiers like private, protected, and public.\n",
    "\n",
    "In JavaScript, encapsulation can be implemented using various techniques, especially since the language has evolved with features in ES6 and beyond to better support OOP principles.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Overview of Encapsulation\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Public**: Properties and methods that can be accessed from anywhere.\n",
    "2. **Private**: Properties and methods that can only be accessed within the class or object.\n",
    "3. **Protected**: Properties and methods that are intended to be accessible only within the class and its subclasses (JavaScript does not have a built-in way to define protected members, but we can mimic this behavior).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Implementing Encapsulation in JavaScript\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Private Properties and Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "Before ES6, JavaScript did not have built-in support for private properties. Developers used conventions (such as naming properties with an underscore) or closures to create private members.\n",

    "### Encapsulation: Private Class Fields and Methods in JavaScript\n",
    "\n",
    "Encapsulation is a fundamental principle in object-oriented programming (OOP), aimed at bundling data (properties) and methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit, typically a class or object. It also involves restricting access to some of an object's components, which is crucial for maintaining the integrity of an object's state.\n",
    "\n",
    "JavaScript, especially with the introduction of ES6 and later versions, has evolved to support better encapsulation practices. In ES2022, private class fields and methods were introduced, providing a standardized way to implement encapsulation in JavaScript classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Private Class Fields and Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "Private fields and methods in JavaScript are defined using a `#` prefix. These fields and methods are only accessible within the class they are declared in, ensuring that they cannot be accessed or modified from outside the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Defining Private Fields\n",
    "\n",
    "Private fields are defined using a `#` prefix before the field name. They are initialized within the class's constructor or directly within the class body.\n",
    "\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "class Person {\n",
    "    #name;  // Private field\n",
    "\n",
    "    constructor(name) {\n",
    "        this.#name = name;\n",
    "    }\n",
    "\n",
    "    getName() {\n",
    "        return this.#name;\n",
    "    }\n",
    "\n",
    "    setName(name) {\n",
    "        this.#name = name;\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "const john = new Person('John');\n",
    "console.log(john.getName());  // Output: John\n",
    "john.setName('Johnny');\n",
    "console.log(john.getName());  // Output: Johnny\n",
    "console.log(john.#name);      // SyntaxError: Private field '#name' must be declared in an enclosing class\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example:\n",
    "- `#name` is a private field.\n",
    "- It can be accessed within the class methods `getName` and `setName`.\n",
    "- Trying to access `#name` directly from outside the class results in a syntax error.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Defining Private Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "Private methods are also defined using a `#` prefix and can only be called within the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "class Person {\n",
    "    #name;  // Private field\n",
    "\n",
    "    constructor(name) {\n",
    "        this.#name = name;\n",
    "    }\n",
    "\n",
    "    #greet() {  // Private method\n",
    "        console.log(`Hello, my name is ${this.#name}`);\n",
    "    }\n",
    "\n",
    "    introduce() {\n",
    "        this.#greet();  // Calling private method within the class\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "const alice = new Person('Alice');\n",
    "alice.introduce();  // Output: Hello, my name is Alice\n",
    "alice.#greet();     // SyntaxError: Private field '#greet' must be declared in an enclosing class\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example:\n",
    "- `#greet` is a private method.\n",
    "- It can be called within the class method `introduce`.\n",
    "- Trying to call `#greet` directly from outside the class results in a syntax error.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Benefits of Using Private Fields and Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Encapsulation**: By restricting access to private fields and methods, you protect the internal state of an object from external interference and misuse.\n",
    "2. **Maintainability**: Private fields and methods help in hiding implementation details, making it easier to change the internal workings of a class without affecting external code.\n",
    "3. **Readability**: The use of private fields and methods clarifies the intended use and scope of different parts of the class, improving code readability.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Combining Private and Public Members\n",
    "\n",
    "A class can have both private and public fields and methods. Public members can interact with private members, but private members cannot be accessed directly from outside the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "class BankAccount {\n",
    "    #balance;  // Private field\n",
    "\n",
    "    constructor(initialBalance) {\n",
    "        this.#balance = initialBalance;\n",
    "    }\n",
    "\n",
    "    #calculateInterest() {  // Private method\n",
    "        return this.#balance * 0.05;\n",
    "    }\n",
    "\n",
    "    deposit(amount) {\n",
    "        this.#balance += amount;\n",
    "        console.log(`Deposited: $${amount}`);\n",
    "    }\n",
    "\n",
    "    withdraw(amount) {\n",
    "        if (amount > this.#balance) {\n",
    "            console.log('Insufficient funds');\n",
    "        } else {\n",
    "            this.#balance -= amount;\n",
    "            console.log(`Withdrew: $${amount}`);\n",
    "        }\n",
    "    }\n",
    "\n",
    "    getBalance() {\n",
    "        return this.#balance;\n",
    "    }\n",
    "\n",
    "    addInterest() {\n",
    "        const interest = this.#calculateInterest();\n",
    "        this.#balance += interest;\n",
    "        console.log(`Added interest: $${interest}`);\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "const account = new BankAccount(1000);\n",
    "account.deposit(500);  // Output: Deposited: $500\n",
    "account.withdraw(200);  // Output: Withdrew: $200\n",
    "console.log(account.getBalance());  // Output: 1300\n",
    "account.addInterest();  // Output: Added interest: $65\n",
    "console.log(account.getBalance());  // Output: 1365\n",
    "console.log(account.#balance);  // SyntaxError: Private field '#balance' must be declared in an enclosing class\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example:\n",
    "- `#balance` is a private field.\n",
    "- `#calculateInterest` is a private method.\n",
    "- Public methods like `deposit`, `withdraw`, `getBalance`, and `addInterest` interact with private members to perform operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Limitations and Considerations\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **No Access from Outside**: Private fields and methods cannot be accessed or modified from outside the class, which is both a feature and a limitation.\n",
    "2. **No Inheritance**: Private fields and methods are not inherited by subclasses. If a subclass needs to access private members, you must use public or protected members instead.\n",
    "3. **Performance**: Using private fields and methods might have some performance overhead compared to using public fields, although this is generally negligible.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Alternatives to Private Fields and Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "Before the introduction of private fields and methods, developers used other techniques to achieve encapsulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Using Closures\n",
    "\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "function createPerson(name) {\n",
    "    let _name = name;  // Private variable\n",
    "\n",
    "    return {\n",
    "        getName() {\n",
    "            return _name;\n",
    "        },\n",
    "        setName(newName) {\n",
    "            _name = newName;\n",
    "        }\n",
    "    };\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "const bob = createPerson('Bob');\n",
    "console.log(bob.getName());  // Output: Bob\n",
    "bob.setName('Bobby');\n",
    "console.log(bob.getName());  // Output: Bobby\n",
    "console.log(bob._name);      // undefined (not directly accessible)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Using WeakMaps\n",
    "\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "const _name = new WeakMap();\n",
    "\n",
    "class Person {\n",
    "    constructor(name) {\n",
    "        _name.set(this, name);\n",
    "    }\n",
    "\n",
    "    getName() {\n",
    "        return _name.get(this);\n",
    "    }\n",
    "\n",
    "    setName(name) {\n",
    "        _name.set(this, name);\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "const charlie = new Person('Charlie');\n",
    "console.log(charlie.getName());  // Output: Charlie\n",
    "charlie.setName('Charles');\n",
    "console.log(charlie.getName());  // Output: Charles\n",
    "console.log(charlie._name);      // undefined (not directly accessible)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Private Class Fields and Methods**: Defined using the `#` prefix, ensuring they are only accessible within the class.\n",
    "- **Benefits**: Improved encapsulation, maintainability, and readability.\n",

    "### Method Chaining in JavaScript: Comprehensive Notes\n",
    "\n",
    "Method chaining is a programming technique that involves calling multiple methods on the same object consecutively in a single statement. This is achieved by ensuring that each method returns the object itself (or a reference to the object), allowing subsequent method calls to be appended. Method chaining can lead to more readable and concise code, especially when performing a series of operations on an object.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Basic Concept of Method Chaining\n",
    "\n",
    "To enable method chaining, methods must return the object instance (`this`) they belong to. Here's a simple example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "class Calculator {\n",
    "    constructor() {\n",
    "        this.value = 0;\n",
    "    }\n",
    "\n",
    "    add(number) {\n",
    "        this.value += number;\n",
    "        return this;\n",
    "    }\n",
    "\n",
    "    subtract(number) {\n",
    "        this.value -= number;\n",
    "        return this;\n",
    "    }\n",
    "\n",
    "    multiply(number) {\n",
    "        this.value *= number;\n",
    "        return this;\n",
    "    }\n",
    "\n",
    "    divide(number) {\n",
    "        if (number !== 0) {\n",
    "            this.value /= number;\n",
    "        } else {\n",
    "            console.error('Cannot divide by zero');\n",
    "        }\n",
    "        return this;\n",
    "    }\n",
    "\n",
    "    getResult() {\n",
    "        return this.value;\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "const calc = new Calculator();\n",
    "const result = calc.add(10).subtract(5).multiply(2).divide(3).getResult();\n",
    "console.log(result);  // Output: 3.3333333333333335\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example:\n",
    "- The `Calculator` class has methods for basic arithmetic operations.\n",
    "- Each method (except `getResult`) returns `this`, allowing method chaining.\n",
    "- The `getResult` method is used to obtain the final result after a chain of operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Advantages of Method Chaining\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Readability**: Chaining methods can make code more readable by expressing a sequence of operations in a linear and intuitive way.\n",
    "2. **Conciseness**: It reduces the need for intermediate variables and multiple statements, leading to more concise code.\n",
    "3. **Fluency**: It provides a fluent interface that mimics natural language, making the code easier to understand.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Implementing Method Chaining\n",
    "\n",
    "To implement method chaining, follow these steps:\n",
    "1. **Return `this` from Methods**: Ensure that methods return the current object (`this`) to allow subsequent method calls.\n",
    "2. **Maintain Context**: Be cautious of losing the context of `this`, especially when using callbacks or asynchronous operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Example: Fluent API for a Book Library\n",
    "\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "class Library {\n",

    "### ES6 Classes in JavaScript: Comprehensive Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "ES6 (ECMAScript 2015) introduced a new syntax for creating objects and dealing with inheritance, known as classes. This new syntax provides a more familiar and clear way to create and manage objects and their inheritance patterns, making JavaScript more accessible to developers coming from other object-oriented programming languages.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Overview of ES6 Classes\n",
    "\n",
    "ES6 classes are syntactical sugar over JavaScript’s existing prototype-based inheritance. The class syntax does not introduce a new object-oriented inheritance model to JavaScript but provides a cleaner and more intuitive way to deal with inheritance and object creation.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Basic Class Syntax\n",
    "\n",
    "A class is defined using the `class` keyword, followed by the class name.\n",
    "\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "class Person {\n",
    "    constructor(name, age) {\n",

    "const john = new Person('John', 30);\n",
    "john.greet();  // Output: Hello, my name is John and I am 30 years old.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Class Declaration\n",
    "\n",
    "Classes can be declared using two main forms:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Class Declaration**: A class is declared with the `class` keyword followed by the class name.\n",
    "   ```javascript\n",

    "           this.height = height;\n",
    "       }\n",
    "\n",
    "       area() {\n",
    "           return this.width * this.height;\n",
    "       }\n",
    "   }\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Class Expression**: A class can also be defined using an expression.\n",
    "   ```javascript\n",
    "   const Rectangle = class {\n",
    "       constructor(width, height) {\n",
    "           this.width = width;\n",
    "           this.height = height;\n",
    "       }\n",

    "           return this.width * this.height;\n",
    "       }\n",
    "   };\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Constructor Method\n",
    "\n",
    "The `constructor` method is a special method for creating and initializing an object created with a class. There can only be one special method with the name `constructor` in a class.\n",
    "\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "class Person {\n",
    "    constructor(name) {\n",
    "        this.name = name;\n",
    "    }\n",
    "\n",
    "    greet() {\n",
    "        console.log(`Hello, my name is ${this.name}`);\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "const alice = new Person('Alice');\n",
    "alice.greet();  // Output: Hello, my name is Alice\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "Methods in ES6 classes are defined without the `function` keyword.\n",
    "\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "class Circle {\n",
    "    constructor(radius) {\n",
    "        this.radius = radius;\n",
    "    }\n",
    "\n",
    "    area() {\n",
    "        return Math.PI * this.radius ** 2;\n",
    "    }\n",
    "\n",
    "    circumference() {\n",
    "        return 2 * Math.PI * this.radius;\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "const circle = new Circle(10);\n",
    "console.log(circle.area());  // Output: 314.1592653589793\n",
    "console.log(circle.circumference());  // Output: 62.83185307179586\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Static Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "Static methods are defined using the `static` keyword. These methods are called on the class itself, not on instances of the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "class MathUtilities {\n",
    "    static square(number) {\n",
    "        return number * number;\n",
    "    }\n",
    "\n",
    "    static cube(number) {\n",
    "        return number * number * number;\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "console.log(MathUtilities.square(3));  // Output: 9\n",
    "console.log(MathUtilities.cube(3));    // Output: 27\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Inheritance\n",
    "\n",
    "Classes can inherit from other classes using the `extends` keyword. The `super` keyword is used to call the constructor and methods of the parent class.\n",
    "\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "class Animal {\n",
    "    constructor(name) {\n",
    "        this.name = name;\n",
    "    }\n",
    "\n",
    "    speak() {\n",
    "        console.log(`${this.name} makes a sound.`);\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "class Dog extends Animal {\n",
    "    constructor(name, breed) {\n",
    "        super(name);  // Call the parent constructor\n",
    "        this.breed = breed;\n",
    "    }\n",
    "\n",
    "    speak() {\n",
    "        super.speak();  // Call the parent method\n",
    "        console.log(`${this.name} barks.`);\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "const dog = new Dog('Rex', 'Golden Retriever');\n",
    "dog.speak();  // Output: Rex makes a sound.\n",
    "              //         Rex barks.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Getters and Setters\n",
    "\n",
    "Getters and setters allow you to define methods that get and set the value of a property.\n",
    "\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "class Rectangle {\n",
    "    constructor(width, height) {\n",
    "        this.width = width;\n",
    "        this.height = height;\n",
    "    }\n",
    "\n",
    "    get area() {\n",
    "        return this.width * this.height;\n",
    "    }\n",
    "\n",
    "    set area(value) {\n",
    "        throw new Error('Cannot set area directly');\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "const rectangle = new Rectangle(10, 20);\n",
    "console.log(rectangle.area);  // Output: 200\n",
    "rectangle.area = 300;         // Throws Error: Cannot set area directly\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Private Fields and Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "ES2022 introduced private class fields and methods using the `#` syntax.\n",
    "\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "class Person {\n",
    "    #name;  // Private field\n",
    "\n",
    "    constructor(name) {\n",
    "        this.#name = name;\n",
    "    }\n",
    "\n",
    "    #greet() {  // Private method\n",
    "        console.log(`Hello, my name is ${this.#name}`);\n",
    "    }\n",
    "\n",
    "    introduce() {\n",
    "        this.#greet();  // Accessing private method within the class\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "const bob = new Person('Bob');\n",
    "bob.introduce();  // Output: Hello, my name is Bob\n",
    "console.log(bob.#name);  // SyntaxError: Private field '#name' must be declared in an enclosing class\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Using `Object.create` with Classes\n",
    "\n",
    "While `Object.create` is not commonly used with classes, understanding its use can help bridge concepts between functional and classical inheritance.\n",
    "\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "const animal = {\n",
    "    speak() {\n",
    "        console.log('Animal speaks');\n",
    "    }\n",
    "};\n",
    "\n",
    "const dog = Object.create(animal);\n",
    "dog.bark = function() {\n",
    "    console.log('Dog barks');\n",
    "};\n",
    "\n",
    "dog.speak();  // Output: Animal speaks\n",
    "dog.bark();   // Output: Dog barks\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Advantages of Using ES6 Classes\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Cleaner Syntax**: Provides a more readable and concise way to define and deal with objects and inheritance.\n",
    "2. **Standardization**: Aligns JavaScript more closely with classical OOP languages, making it easier for developers to switch between languages.\n",
    "3. **Enhanced Functionality**: Includes features like static methods, getters, setters, and private fields/methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Class Declaration**: Using the `class` keyword to define a class.\n",
    "- **Constructor**: A special method for initializing new objects.\n",
    "- **Methods**: Functions defined within the class body.\n",
    "- **Static Methods**: Methods that are called on the class itself, not on instances.\n",
    "- **Inheritance**: Using `extends` and `super` to create subclasses.\n",
    "- **Getters and Setters**: Define methods to get and set property values.\n",
    "- **Private Fields and Methods**: Using `#` to define private members.\n",
    "\n",
    "ES6 classes provide a powerful and intuitive way to work with objects and inheritance in JavaScript, making the language more robust and accessible for developers familiar with OOP concepts. Understanding these features is crucial for writing clean, maintainable, and scalable JavaScript code.\n",
