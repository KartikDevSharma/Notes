### Week 3: Graphing and Visualization
#### Day 15-17: Basic Graphing with RRDtool


---

### 1. **RRDtool Graphing Basics**

The `rrdtool graph` command is used to create graphs from the data stored in an RRD. The graphs can display trends over time for metrics like CPU load, memory usage, network traffic, etc. This command offers many customization options, including specifying colors, labels, titles, and various types of plots.

#### **Graph Command Syntax**:
```bash
rrdtool graph <output.png> [options]
```

- **output.png**: The name of the image file that the graph will be saved as (e.g., `graph.png`).
- **options**: There are numerous options for defining data sources, graph styles, colors, titles, etc.

#### **Example**:
```bash
rrdtool graph cpu_graph.png --start -1d --end now --title "CPU Load" \
DEF:cpuload=system_stats.rrd:cpu_load:AVERAGE \
LINE1:cpuload#00FF00:"CPU Load"
```

- **`DEF:`**: Defines a data source from the RRD (in this case, the `cpu_load` data source). You specify the RRD file, the data source, and the consolidation function (`AVERAGE`, `MAX`, `MIN`, etc.).
- **`LINE1:`**: Draws a line on the graph for the `cpuload` data source. `#00FF00` specifies the line color (green), and `"CPU Load"` is the label for the line.

---

### 2. **Step-by-Step Guide to Create Simple Line Graphs**

#### **Step 1: Define the Data Source (DEF)**

The `DEF:` option allows you to define the data you want to plot from an RRD file.

```bash
DEF:cpuload=system_stats.rrd:cpu_load:AVERAGE
```
This defines `cpuload` as the **average** values of the `cpu_load` data source in the `system_stats.rrd` file. The consolidation function (`AVERAGE`) determines how the data is aggregated over time intervals.

#### **Step 2: Plot the Data (LINE)**

Once the data source is defined, you can use `LINE1`, `LINE2`, `LINE3`, etc., to draw a line on the graph. The number after `LINE` represents the thickness of the line.

```bash
LINE1:cpuload#00FF00:"CPU Load"
```

- **`cpuload`**: Refers to the previously defined data source.
- **`#00FF00`**: Specifies the line color (hexadecimal for green).
- **`"CPU Load"`**: Label that appears in the graph legend.

#### **Step 3: Set the Time Range (start/end)**

You can specify the time range for the graph using the `--start` and `--end` options.

```bash
--start -1d --end now
```

- **`--start -1d`**: Start the graph from one day ago.
- **`--end now`**: End the graph at the current time.

#### **Step 4: Add a Title**

You can give your graph a title using the `--title` option.

```bash
--title "CPU Load"
```

---

### 3. **Adding Labels and Customizing Graphs**

Once you understand the basics, you can experiment with customizing your graphs. You can add labels, adjust the axis, and play with colors to make the graph more readable and informative.

#### **Customizing Line Colors and Labels**

You can define multiple lines, each with different colors and labels. For instance, if you're plotting both CPU load and memory usage on the same graph:

```bash
rrdtool graph system_stats.png --start -1d --end now --title "System Stats" \
DEF:cpuload=system_stats.rrd:cpu_load:AVERAGE \
DEF:memusage=system_stats.rrd:memory_usage:AVERAGE \
LINE1:cpuload#00FF00:"CPU Load" \
LINE2:memusage#0000FF:"Memory Usage"
```

This creates a graph with:
- A green line for CPU load (`LINE1:cpuload#00FF00`).
- A blue line for memory usage (`LINE2:memusage#0000FF`).

#### **Adjusting Axis Labels**

You can add custom labels to the X and Y axes using the `--vertical-label` and `--x-grid` options.

```bash
--vertical-label "Load/Usage (%)"
```

This adds a vertical label to the Y-axis (representing the percentage of CPU load or memory usage).

#### **Adding a Legend**

You can use the `COMMENT` option to add custom text or legend to your graph.

```bash
COMMENT:"\n"
COMMENT:"CPU Load (green) and Memory Usage (blue)\n"
```

This adds a description below the graph.

---

### 4. **Experimenting with More Graphing Options**

Here are additional customization options to enhance your graphs:

#### **Area Graphs**

Instead of a line, you can fill the area under the line using the `AREA` option. This makes it easier to visualize the cumulative or total values over time.

```bash
rrdtool graph system_stats_area.png --start -1d --end now --title "System Stats Area Graph" \
DEF:cpuload=system_stats.rrd:cpu_load:AVERAGE \
AREA:cpuload#00FF00:"CPU Load" \
LINE1:cpuload#006600
```

- **`AREA:cpuload#00FF00`**: Fills the area under the `cpu_load` curve with green.
- **`LINE1:cpuload#006600`**: Adds a darker green line on top of the area for better visibility.

#### **Stacking Values**

You can stack multiple areas on top of each other using the `STACK` option. This is useful when plotting metrics that contribute to a total, such as different types of network traffic.

```bash
rrdtool graph network_stats.png --start -1d --end now --title "Network Traffic" \
DEF:incoming=network_traffic.rrd:incoming:AVERAGE \
DEF:outgoing=network_traffic.rrd:outgoing:AVERAGE \
AREA:incoming#00FF00:"Incoming Traffic" \
STACK:outgoing#0000FF:"Outgoing Traffic"
```

- The `STACK` option stacks the `outgoing` traffic area on top of the `incoming` traffic.

---

### 5. **Exercises to Practice**

To solidify your understanding, here are a few exercises to practice:

#### **Exercise 1: Create a Line Graph**
- Use the data in your existing RRD (e.g., CPU load and memory usage) and create a basic line graph showing these metrics over the past day.
- Experiment with colors, line thickness, and labels.

#### **Exercise 2: Create an Area Graph**
- Create an area graph for one of your data sources (e.g., CPU load).
- Use a darker color for the line on top of the area to improve readability.

#### **Exercise 3: Add a Stacked Graph**
- If you have multiple data sources in your RRD (e.g., incoming and outgoing network traffic), create a stacked graph showing both values.
- Stack the outgoing traffic on top of the incoming traffic.

#### **Exercise 4: Customize with Labels and Titles**
- Add a title, vertical axis label, and custom legend to your graph.
- Try to make your graph as informative and clear as possible.

---

### Summary

- Be able to create simple line graphs using the data in your RRDs.
- Know how to customize graphs with colors, labels, titles, and legends.
- Experiment with different types of graphs, such as area and stacked graphs, to better visualize your data.

### Day 18-20: Advanced Graphing with RRDtool

We will build on the basic graphing skills we’ve developed to create more complex and informative visualizations. This includes exploring different types of graphs like area and stacked graphs, combining multiple data sources into a single graph, and creating complex multi-element graphs that provide more detailed insights.

---

### 1. **Advanced Graph Types**

RRDtool allows you to create different types of graphs that are useful for various visualization needs. Some of the more advanced graph types include **area** and **stack** graphs, which are especially helpful for visualizing cumulative data.

#### **Area Graphs**

An **area graph** fills the space under a line, making it easier to visualize the magnitude of the data over time. This is particularly useful for metrics like CPU usage, where the total load can be better appreciated when filled.

##### **Syntax**:
```bash
rrdtool graph output_area.png --start -1d --end now --title "Area Graph Example" \
DEF:cpuload=system_stats.rrd:cpu_load:AVERAGE \
AREA:cpuload#FF9999:"CPU Load"
```

- **`AREA:cpuload#FF9999:"CPU Load"`**: Fills the area under the `cpuload` line with a soft pink color (`#FF9999`).

#### **Stacked Graphs**

A **stacked graph** is useful when you have multiple data sources that represent parts of a whole. For example, in a network graph, you can stack **incoming** and **outgoing** traffic to show the total network usage.

##### **Syntax**:
```bash
rrdtool graph network_traffic.png --start -1d --end now --title "Network Traffic (Stacked)" \
DEF:incoming=network_traffic.rrd:incoming:AVERAGE \
DEF:outgoing=network_traffic.rrd:outgoing:AVERAGE \
AREA:incoming#00FF00:"Incoming Traffic" \
STACK:outgoing#0000FF:"Outgoing Traffic"
```

- **`AREA:incoming#00FF00:"Incoming Traffic"`**: Fills the area for incoming traffic with a green color.
- **`STACK:outgoing#0000FF:"Outgoing Traffic"`**: Stacks the outgoing traffic on top of the incoming traffic, filling it with a blue color.

This graph clearly shows the cumulative network traffic, with the outgoing traffic layered on top of the incoming traffic.

#### **Overlaying Line and Area Graphs**

You can combine different graph types by overlaying lines on top of area graphs to highlight important trends.

##### **Example**:
```bash
rrdtool graph combined_graph.png --start -1d --end now --title "CPU Load with Overlay" \
DEF:cpuload=system_stats.rrd:cpu_load:AVERAGE \
AREA:cpuload#CCCCFF:"CPU Load" \
LINE1:cpuload#0000FF:"CPU Load Line"
```

- **`AREA:cpuload#CCCCFF`**: Fills the area under the CPU load curve with a light blue color.
- **`LINE1:cpuload#0000FF`**: Overlays a blue line on top of the area graph to highlight the exact data points.

---

### 2. **Combining Multiple Data Sources**

Often, you need to visualize multiple metrics on the same graph to compare their trends over time. RRDtool allows you to combine multiple **data sources (DS)** from the same or different RRDs in a single graph.

#### **Example: Combining CPU and Memory Usage**

Let’s say you want to visualize **CPU load** and **memory usage** on the same graph.

##### **Syntax**:
```bash
rrdtool graph system_stats_combined.png --start -1d --end now --title "CPU and Memory Usage" \
DEF:cpuload=system_stats.rrd:cpu_load:AVERAGE \
DEF:memusage=system_stats.rrd:memory_usage:AVERAGE \
LINE1:cpuload#FF0000:"CPU Load" \
LINE1:memusage#0000FF:"Memory Usage"
```

- **`DEF:cpuload`** and **`DEF:memusage`**: Define data sources for CPU load and memory usage from the same RRD.
- **`LINE1:cpuload#FF0000`**: Draws a red line for CPU load.
- **`LINE1:memusage#0000FF`**: Draws a blue line for memory usage.

This graph lets you easily compare CPU load and memory usage trends over time.

---

### 3. **Creating Complex, Multi-Element Graphs**

Multi-element graphs combine multiple lines, areas, stacks, and legends to provide a richer view of the data. These graphs are useful for detailed monitoring dashboards.

#### **Example: Complex System Monitoring Graph**

This graph shows CPU load, memory usage, and network traffic (incoming and outgoing) on the same graph:

##### **Syntax**:
```bash
rrdtool graph complex_system_stats.png --start -1d --end now --title "System Stats (Complex)" \
DEF:cpuload=system_stats.rrd:cpu_load:AVERAGE \
DEF:memusage=system_stats.rrd:memory_usage:AVERAGE \
DEF:incoming=network_traffic.rrd:incoming:AVERAGE \
DEF:outgoing=network_traffic.rrd:outgoing:AVERAGE \
LINE2:cpuload#FF0000:"CPU Load" \
LINE1:memusage#0000FF:"Memory Usage" \
AREA:incoming#00FF00:"Incoming Traffic" \
STACK:outgoing#0000FF:"Outgoing Traffic" \
COMMENT:"\n" \
COMMENT:"CPU (Red), Memory (Blue), Incoming (Green), Outgoing (Blue)\n"
```

- **`LINE2:cpuload`**: A thicker red line for CPU load.
- **`LINE1:memusage`**: A blue line for memory usage.
- **`AREA:incoming`**: A green area for incoming traffic.
- **`STACK:outgoing`**: A stacked blue area for outgoing traffic.
- **`COMMENT`**: Adds a custom legend explaining the graph elements.

#### **Adding Custom Text and Formatting**

The `COMMENT` option is useful for adding text directly to the graph, such as descriptions or extra context. You can use `GPRINT` to print calculated values like the **average** or **maximum** value of a data source directly onto the graph.

##### **Example with GPRINT**:
```bash
rrdtool graph complex_graph_with_text.png --start -1d --end now --title "System Stats" \
DEF:cpuload=system_stats.rrd:cpu_load:AVERAGE \
LINE1:cpuload#FF0000:"CPU Load" \
GPRINT:cpuload:AVERAGE:"Avg CPU Load\: %6.2lf"
```

- **`GPRINT:cpuload:AVERAGE:"Avg CPU Load: %6.2lf"`**: Prints the average CPU load in the graph with a formatted string.

---

### 4. **Advanced Graph Customization**

RRDtool provides many advanced customization options for fine-tuning the look and feel of your graphs.

#### **Customize Axis and Grids**

You can customize the X and Y axes by defining the scale, labels, and grid intervals:

##### **Syntax**:
```bash
--vertical-label "Percentage (%)" \
--x-grid MINUTE:10:HOUR:1:HOUR:1:0:%H \
--y-grid 10:5
```

- **`--vertical-label`**: Adds a label to the Y-axis.
- **`--x-grid`**: Specifies the X-axis grid intervals (e.g., 10-minute intervals).
- **`--y-grid`**: Specifies the Y-axis grid scale (e.g., intervals of 10%).

#### **Custom Colors and Styling**

You can use RRDtool’s advanced color settings to customize almost every aspect of the graph:

```bash
--color CANVAS#FFFFFF \
--color GRID#CCCCCC \
--color MGRID#FF0000 \
--color FONT#000000 \
--font DEFAULT:10:Arial
```

- **`CANVAS#FFFFFF`**: Sets the background color to white.
- **`GRID#CCCCCC`**: Sets the grid color to light gray.
- **`MGRID#FF0000`**: Sets the major grid color to red.
- **`FONT#000000`**: Sets the default font color to black.
- **`DEFAULT:10:Arial`**: Changes the font to Arial, size 10.

#### **Legends and Data Value Printing**

You can control the legend placement and even remove it if needed:

```bash
--no-legend
```

This removes the legend from the graph. To fine-tune the legend layout, you can use options like `COMMENT`, `GPRINT`, and `PRINT`.

---

### 5. **Exercises to Practice**

#### **Exercise 1: Create a Stacked Graph**
- Use the **network traffic** data in your RRD and create a **stacked area graph** showing incoming and outgoing traffic.

#### **Exercise 2: Combine Multiple Data Sources**
- Combine **CPU load**, **memory usage**, and **network traffic** into a single graph with distinct colors and lines for each data source.

#### **Exercise 3: Customize Axes and Labels**
- Create a graph with custom X and Y axes, adjust the grid intervals, and experiment with custom axis labels and font sizes.

#### **Exercise 

4: Add Text and Values to Graphs**
- Create a graph where you use `GPRINT` to show the average or maximum value of a data source on the graph.

---

### Day 21: Data Consolidation Functions in RRDtool

RRDtool supports several **data consolidation functions** (DCFs) that aggregate data points over specific time intervals. These functions are crucial for creating meaningful graphs that summarize data over time, especially when dealing with long-term datasets. Today, we will explore different DCFs like **AVERAGE**, **MAX**, **MIN**, and **LAST**, understand when to use each function, and practice applying them in graphs.

---

### 1. **What Are Data Consolidation Functions (DCFs)?**

In RRDtool, data is stored in **Round Robin Archives (RRAs)**, which can consolidate raw data points into summary values for specific time intervals. DCFs help RRDtool determine **how to summarize this data** when plotting it over time.

For example, if you have collected CPU usage data every minute but are creating a graph that covers a whole month, it wouldn’t make sense to show every minute of data. Instead, RRDtool can **consolidate** the data by averaging, taking the maximum, or other forms of aggregation.

### 2. **Types of Data Consolidation Functions**

#### **1. AVERAGE**

- **Definition**: The `AVERAGE` DCF calculates the mean value of all data points within a specific time period.
- **Use Case**: Ideal for visualizing data trends over time, as it smooths out any short-term spikes or drops. Often used when you want to see a general trend, such as average CPU load over a day.

##### **Example**:
```bash
rrdtool graph avg_cpu_load.png --start -1d --title "Average CPU Load" \
DEF:cpuload=system_stats.rrd:cpu_load:AVERAGE \
LINE1:cpuload#0000FF:"CPU Load (Average)"
```

- **Explanation**: This graph shows the **average CPU load** over a day, using the `AVERAGE` DCF to smooth out the data points.

#### **2. MAX (Maximum)**

- **Definition**: The `MAX` DCF selects the maximum value from all data points within a consolidation period.
- **Use Case**: Useful for identifying peak loads or critical points where resource usage hits its highest values. This function is often used in scenarios like **maximum CPU load** or **peak network traffic**.

##### **Example**:
```bash
rrdtool graph max_cpu_load.png --start -1d --title "Maximum CPU Load" \
DEF:cpuload=system_stats.rrd:cpu_load:MAX \
LINE1:cpuload#FF0000:"CPU Load (Max)"
```

- **Explanation**: This graph shows the **maximum CPU load** in each consolidation period, which can highlight peak usage times.

#### **3. MIN (Minimum)**

- **Definition**: The `MIN` DCF selects the minimum value from all data points within the consolidation period.
- **Use Case**: Useful when tracking the lowest usage points, like minimum disk space used or periods of least network activity.

##### **Example**:
```bash
rrdtool graph min_cpu_load.png --start -1d --title "Minimum CPU Load" \
DEF:cpuload=system_stats.rrd:cpu_load:MIN \
LINE1:cpuload#00FF00:"CPU Load (Min)"
```

- **Explanation**: This graph shows the **minimum CPU load** over time, useful for identifying periods of low resource usage.

#### **4. LAST**

- **Definition**: The `LAST` DCF uses the last known value from the data points in the consolidation period.
- **Use Case**: Typically used when you need to know the most recent value of a metric, like the **latest CPU load** or **last network traffic reading**. It’s particularly useful for real-time monitoring.

##### **Example**:
```bash
rrdtool graph last_cpu_load.png --start -1d --title "Last CPU Load" \
DEF:cpuload=system_stats.rrd:cpu_load:LAST \
LINE1:cpuload#0000FF:"CPU Load (Last)"
```

- **Explanation**: This graph uses the **last value** of CPU load in each period, showing the most recent state of the system at each time interval.

---

### 3. **When to Use Each Function?**

Each DCF serves a different purpose depending on what you're trying to visualize. Here’s a guide on when to use them:

| **DCF**    | **Use Case**                                     | **Example**                             |
|------------|--------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| **AVERAGE**| For general trends, smoothing out short-term fluctuations | Average CPU load over a day             |
| **MAX**    | To highlight peak or critical values             | Maximum network traffic during the day  |
| **MIN**    | To track the lowest points of a metric           | Minimum disk space usage                |
| **LAST**   | When you care about the most recent value        | Latest CPU load                         |

---

### 4. **Applying Consolidation Functions in Graphs**

#### **Multiple Consolidation Functions in One Graph**

You can visualize multiple DCFs in the same graph to compare different aspects of the data, such as average versus maximum values.

##### **Example**:
```bash
rrdtool graph cpu_load_comparison.png --start -1d --title "CPU Load (Avg, Max, Min)" \
DEF:cpuload_avg=system_stats.rrd:cpu_load:AVERAGE \
DEF:cpuload_max=system_stats.rrd:cpu_load:MAX \
DEF:cpuload_min=system_stats.rrd:cpu_load:MIN \
LINE1:cpuload_avg#0000FF:"CPU Load (Average)" \
LINE1:cpuload_max#FF0000:"CPU Load (Max)" \
LINE1:cpuload_min#00FF00:"CPU Load (Min)"
```

- **Explanation**: This graph shows the **average**, **maximum**, and **minimum** CPU load over time. The different lines represent each DCF, allowing for easy comparison.

#### **Displaying LAST Value on Graphs**

The `LAST` DCF is often used alongside `GPRINT` to show the most recent value on the graph itself:

##### **Example**:
```bash
rrdtool graph last_value_cpu.png --start -1d --title "Last CPU Load Value" \
DEF:cpuload=system_stats.rrd:cpu_load:LAST \
LINE1:cpuload#0000FF:"CPU Load (Last)" \
GPRINT:cpuload:LAST:"Last Value\: %6.2lf"
```

- **Explanation**: This graph displays the **last CPU load value** at the bottom of the graph using `GPRINT`, which prints the most recent value.

---

### 5. **Exercises to Practice**

#### **Exercise 1: Create an AVERAGE Graph**
- Use your system stats RRD to create a graph showing **average CPU load** over the past 24 hours.

#### **Exercise 2: Compare AVERAGE and MAX**
- Create a graph that compares **average** and **maximum CPU load**. Try to use different colors for each line.

#### **Exercise 3: Visualize LAST Value**
- Create a graph showing the **last value** of CPU load and print this value using `GPRINT` at the bottom of the graph.

#### **Exercise 4: Display Multiple DCFs**
- Create a graph that shows **average**, **minimum**, and **maximum** values for network traffic in a single visualization. Use different colors and line thicknesses to differentiate the data.

---
