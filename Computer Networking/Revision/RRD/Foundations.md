### Week 1: Foundations  

### 1. **What is RRDtool?**

**RRDtool** is a powerful, open-source tool designed to handle time-series data (data points measured over time). It stores and displays data efficiently, making it useful for monitoring systems and network performance.

#### **Key Concepts**:  

- **Round Robin Database (RRD)**:  
  - An RRD is a fixed-size database, which is the main strength of RRDtool. It stores time-series data (like network traffic, CPU load, temperature, etc.) and uses a fixed amount of space, even if the database stores data over long periods.
  - When it reaches the end of its capacity, RRDtool overwrites the oldest data with new data. This "circular buffer" design ensures that the tool always uses a set amount of storage, regardless of the amount of incoming data.

- **Primary Uses**:
  - **Network Monitoring**: RRDtool is frequently used for monitoring network bandwidth, traffic, and error rates.
  - **System Performance**: Tracking metrics such as CPU load, memory usage, and disk utilization.
  - **Environmental Data Logging**: Monitoring room temperature, humidity, etc.
  - **Data Visualization**: RRDtool includes graphing capabilities to visualize trends and patterns over time.
  
- **Core Features**:
  - **Data Storage**: Fixed-size, efficient, with automatic data aggregation over time.
  - **Data Visualization**: Generates visual graphs for data analysis.
  - **Data Updates**: You can continuously update the RRD database with new data at fixed intervals.

### 2. **Why Should You Use RRDtool?**

RRDtool is ideal for situations where you need to:
- **Collect and store data** at regular intervals (e.g., every minute or every hour).
- **Prevent uncontrolled data growth**, since the database size stays constant.
- **Visualize data trends** over time in an easy-to-understand way (graphs).

It is widely used in **system administration, DevOps, and network engineering** roles for monitoring systems and network performance. Given your career focus on DevOps and network engineering, learning RRDtool will help you handle monitoring tasks effectively.

### 3. **Set Up Your Development Environment**

#### **Step 1: Install Linux (If Not Already Using It)**

If you're not yet using Linux, you can either **install Linux** as your main operating system or use a virtual machine to run it. Most system administrators and network engineers use Linux due to its stability, flexibility, and compatibility with various tools like RRDtool.

**Popular Linux Distributions**:
- **Ubuntu**: Great for beginners.
- **CentOS**: Common in enterprise settings.
- **Debian**: Known for stability.
- **Fedora**: Known for cutting-edge software.

You can install Linux by:
- **Creating a bootable USB drive** (using tools like Rufus) and installing Linux directly on your system.
- **Running a Linux Virtual Machine** (VM) via software like **VirtualBox** or **VMware** to run Linux alongside your main operating system.

#### **Step 2: Install RRDtool on Linux**

1. **Update your package list** to ensure you have the latest version:
   ```bash
   sudo apt update  # For Ubuntu/Debian
   sudo yum update  # For CentOS
   ```

2. **Install RRDtool**:
   - On Ubuntu/Debian:
     ```bash
     sudo apt install rrdtool
     ```
   - On CentOS/Fedora:
     ```bash
     sudo yum install rrdtool
     ```
   
3. **Verify the Installation**:
   - Run `rrdtool` in the terminal to ensure the tool is installed and accessible.

#### **Step 3: Set Up Your Development Environment**

For RRDtool to work seamlessly with other software in a monitoring setup, you may want to install some additional tools.

- **Text Editor**: You’ll need a good text editor to edit scripts. Popular options include:
  - **Visual Studio Code** (VSCode): A powerful, free editor with great extensions.
    ```bash
    sudo snap install --classic code  # For Ubuntu
    ```
  - **Vim**: A powerful, terminal-based editor:
    ```bash
    sudo apt install vim  # For Ubuntu/Debian
    sudo yum install vim  # For CentOS
    ```

- **Git**: Version control is important for managing your code.
  - Install Git:
    ```bash
    sudo apt install git
    sudo yum install git
    ```

- **Python (Optional but Recommended)**: Many monitoring systems integrate with Python, and RRDtool has Python bindings.
  - Install Python 3:
    ```bash
    sudo apt install python3
    sudo yum install python3
    ```

### 4. **First Steps with RRDtool**

Now that your environment is set up, you can begin exploring RRDtool. Here’s a simple exercise to start:

1. **Create a Round Robin Database (RRD)**:
   - To store time-series data, you need to first create an RRD.
     ```bash
     rrdtool create mydata.rrd --step 300 \
     DS:traffic:COUNTER:600:U:U RRA:AVERAGE:0.5:1:600
     ```
   - **Explanation**:
     - `mydata.rrd`: The database file.
     - `--step 300`: This defines the data collection interval as 300 seconds (5 minutes).
     - `DS:traffic:COUNTER`: This defines a data source called "traffic" that counts incoming values.
     - `RRA:AVERAGE`: Defines a Round Robin Archive that stores averaged values over time.
   
2. **Updating the Database**:
   - After creating the RRD, you need to feed it data at regular intervals.
     ```bash
     rrdtool update mydata.rrd N:100
     ```
   - **Explanation**:
     - `N` represents the current timestamp.
     - `100` is the data value you are adding (e.g., network traffic data).

3. **Generating a Graph**:
   - You can visualize the data stored in the RRD with graphs.
     ```bash
     rrdtool graph traffic.png --start -1h \
     DEF:mytraffic=mydata.rrd:traffic:AVERAGE \
     LINE1:mytraffic#FF0000:"Network Traffic"
     ```
   - **Explanation**:
     - This command creates a graph (`traffic.png`) of the last hour's data.
     - `LINE1` draws a red line for the traffic data.

### Week 1: Foundations  
#### Day 3-4: Linux and Command Line Basics

---

### 1. **What is the Linux Command Line?**

The **Linux command line** (or terminal) is a text interface that allows you to interact with your operating system by typing commands. Instead of clicking icons or using a graphical interface, you type specific commands to perform actions.

#### **Why Learn It?**
- **Efficiency**: Many tasks (like managing servers, automation, and monitoring) are faster and easier via the terminal.
- **Flexibility**: You can perform a wide variety of tasks, from file manipulation to network troubleshooting, using simple commands.
- **Scripting**: You can automate repetitive tasks by writing **bash scripts**, which are essentially sequences of commands saved in a file and executed all at once.

---

### 2. **Essential Linux Commands**

Here are some of the most important Linux commands every beginner should know. These commands help you **navigate** the file system, **manage files and directories**, and **control permissions**.

#### **Navigating the File System**  
- `pwd` (Print Working Directory):  
  Displays the current directory you're working in.
  ```bash
  pwd
  ```
  
- `ls` (List):  
  Lists files and directories in the current directory.  
  Options:
  - `-l`: Displays a detailed list (permissions, owner, size, date).
  - `-a`: Shows hidden files (files starting with `.`).
  ```bash
  ls
  ls -la
  ```

- `cd` (Change Directory):  
  Changes your current directory.
  ```bash
  cd /path/to/directory  # Absolute path
  cd ..  # Go up one directory
  ```

#### **File and Directory Manipulation**  
- `touch`:  
  Creates an empty file or updates the timestamp of an existing file.
  ```bash
  touch myfile.txt
  ```

- `mkdir` (Make Directory):  
  Creates a new directory (folder).
  ```bash
  mkdir mydirectory
  ```

- `cp` (Copy):  
  Copies files or directories.
  ```bash
  cp source.txt destination.txt  # Copy a file
  cp -r /path/to/source /path/to/destination  # Copy a directory (-r for recursive)
  ```

- `mv` (Move):  
  Moves or renames files and directories.
  ```bash
  mv oldname.txt newname.txt  # Rename a file
  mv file.txt /path/to/destination/  # Move a file to another directory
  ```

- `rm` (Remove):  
  Deletes files or directories.
  ```bash
  rm file.txt  # Delete a file
  rm -r directoryname  # Delete a directory (-r for recursive)
  ```

#### **Viewing File Contents**  
- `cat`:  
  Displays the content of a file.
  ```bash
  cat file.txt
  ```

- `head`/`tail`:  
  Views the first (`head`) or last (`tail`) 10 lines of a file.
  ```bash
  head file.txt
  tail file.txt
  ```

- `less`/`more`:  
  Views the contents of a file one page at a time.
  ```bash
  less file.txt
  more file.txt
  ```

#### **Permissions and Ownership**  
- `chmod` (Change Mode):  
  Changes file or directory permissions (read, write, execute).
  ```bash
  chmod 755 script.sh  # Give execute permissions to the script
  chmod 644 file.txt   # Sets read/write for owner, read-only for others
  ```

- `chown` (Change Ownership):  
  Changes the owner of a file or directory.
  ```bash
  chown user:usergroup file.txt
  ```

#### **System Information and Process Management**  
- `df` (Disk Free):  
  Displays the amount of disk space available.
  ```bash
  df -h  # The -h flag shows the output in human-readable format (MB, GB, etc.)
  ```

- `top` / `htop`:  
  Displays running processes and system resource usage.
  ```bash
  top
  ```

- `ps`:  
  Lists currently running processes.
  ```bash
  ps aux
  ```

- `kill`:  
  Kills a process by its PID (Process ID).
  ```bash
  kill 1234
  ```

#### **Networking Commands**  
- `ping`:  
  Sends a network packet to a server to test connectivity.
  ```bash
  ping google.com
  ```

- `ifconfig` / `ip addr`:  
  Displays or configures network interfaces.

  ip addr
  ```

- `netstat`:  
  Displays network connections, routing tables, and interface statistics.
  ```bash
  netstat -tuln
  ```

### 3. **Basic File Manipulation and Redirection**

Linux commands allow you to manipulate data from files and pass it between commands. This can be done using **redirection** and **pipes**.

#### **Redirection**:
- `>`: Redirects the output of a command to a file (overwrites the file).
  ```bash
  echo "Hello World" > hello.txt  # Writes "Hello World" into hello.txt
  ```

- `>>`: Appends the output of a command to a file.
  ```bash
  echo "More text" >> hello.txt  # Appends "More text" to hello.txt
  ```

- `<`: Reads input from a file.
  ```bash
  wc -l < file.txt  # Counts the lines in file.txt
  ```

#### **Piping (`|`)**:
Piping lets you pass the output of one command as the input of another command.
  ```bash
  ls | grep myfile  # Lists files and filters for "myfile"
  ```

#### **Other Useful Commands**:
- `grep`: Searches for patterns in text.
  ```bash
  grep "error" logfile.txt  # Search for the word "error" in a log file
  ```

- `find`: Finds files or directories based on name or properties.
  ```bash
  find /path/to/search -name "file.txt"  # Search for "file.txt"
  ```

- `wc` (Word Count): Counts lines, words, and characters in a file.
  ```bash
  wc -l file.txt  # Counts lines in file.txt
  ```

---

### 4. **Scripting in Bash**

Bash scripting is one of the most powerful features of Linux, allowing you to automate tasks by writing a series of commands in a file (called a "script").

#### **Create a Simple Bash Script**:
1. **Create a new file**:
   ```bash
   touch myscript.sh
   ```

2. **Make the file executable**:
   ```bash
   chmod +x myscript.sh
   ```

3. **Open the file in a text editor** and add the following code:
   ```bash
   #!/bin/bash
   # This is a simple bash script

   echo "Hello, World!"
   ```

4. **Run the script**:
   ```bash
   ./myscript.sh
   ```

#### **Basic Script Components**:
- **Shebang (`#!/bin/bash`)**:  
  This tells the system which interpreter to use (in this case, bash).
  
- **Variables**:  
  You can store values in variables and use them in your script.
  ```bash
  name="John"
  echo "Hello, $name!"
  ```

- **Conditionals**:  
  You can add logic to your script with `if` statements.
  ```bash
  if [ $name == "John" ]; then
    echo "Hello, John!"
  else
    echo "Who are you?"
  fi
  ```

- **Loops**:  
  You can repeat tasks using loops.
  ```bash
  for i in {1..5}; do
    echo "Iteration $i"
  done
  ```

#### **Useful Bash Script Example**: Backup Script  
Let’s create a simple backup script to back up a directory.

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Simple backup script

SOURCE="/home/user/documents"
DEST="/home/user/backup"
DATE=$(date +%Y-%m-%d)

# Create a backup folder with the current date
mkdir -p $DEST/$DATE

# Copy all files from source to destination
cp -r $SOURCE/* $DEST/$DATE/

echo "Backup completed on $DATE"
```

This script copies files from the `documents` folder to a `backup` folder, creating a new folder for each day.

### 5. **Practice Exercises**

Here are some exercises to solidify your understanding of Linux commands and bash scripting:

1. **File Manipulation**:
   - Create a directory named `myproject` and inside it, create three empty files: `file1.txt`, `file2.txt`, and `file3.txt`.
   - Write "Hello, World!" into `file1.txt` and append "This is a test" to the same file

.
   - Move `file2.txt` to another directory.
   - Delete `file3.txt`.

2. **Writing Bash Scripts**:
   - Write a script that accepts a **filename** as input and prints the number of lines, words, and characters in the file.
   - Write a script that checks if a file exists and prints a message based on whether it does or not.
