# OpenNMS Development Topics: A Simple Summary

## 1. Build from Source

### What is it?
Building from source means creating the OpenNMS software from its raw code instead of using a pre-built version.

### Why do it?
- Customize OpenNMS for specific needs
- Contribute to OpenNMS development
- Understand how OpenNMS works internally

### In simple terms:
It's like baking a cake from scratch instead of buying one. You have more control over the ingredients and can make changes as needed.

## 2. OSGi Integration

### What is it?
OSGi is a system that helps manage and run different parts of OpenNMS as separate modules.

### Why use it?
- Makes OpenNMS more flexible and easier to update
- Allows adding or removing features without restarting the whole system
- Improves overall system stability

### In simple terms:
Think of OSGi like building with Lego blocks. You can add, remove, or replace individual blocks (features) without taking apart the whole structure.

## 3. Minion Development

### What is it?
Creating or modifying Minions, which are the remote helpers for OpenNMS.

### Why do it?
- Add new capabilities to Minions
- Customize Minions for specific network environments
- Improve how Minions communicate with the main OpenNMS system

### In simple terms:
It's like training and equipping field agents (Minions) with new skills to gather more types of information or work in special environments.

## 4. Topology

### What is it?
Developing how OpenNMS understands and displays the structure of your network.

### Why work on it?
- Improve how network relationships are shown
- Create custom views of network structure
- Enhance network navigation and troubleshooting

### In simple terms:
It's like working on an interactive map of your network, making it easier to see how everything is connected and find problems.

## 5. Graph Service API

### What is it?
An interface for creating and manipulating graphs (visual representations of data) in OpenNMS.

### Why use it?
- Create custom graphs for specific data
- Integrate new types of visual representations
- Improve how data is displayed to users

### In simple terms:
This is like having a toolbox for creating different types of charts and diagrams to show your network data in the most useful way.

## 6. CORS Support

### What is it?
CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) allows web applications from different domains to interact with OpenNMS.

### Why implement it?
- Enable integration with external web applications
- Improve security for web-based interactions
- Allow development of custom web interfaces for OpenNMS

### In simple terms:
It's like setting up secure communication channels so that OpenNMS can safely talk to web applications running on different websites or servers.

## 7. REST API

### What is it?
A way for other programs to interact with OpenNMS over the internet using standard commands.

### Why develop it?
- Allow integration with other software systems
- Enable creation of custom tools and interfaces for OpenNMS
- Automate interactions with OpenNMS

### In simple terms:
Think of it as creating a universal language that allows OpenNMS to communicate with other software, making it easier to build tools that work with OpenNMS.

## 8. Plugin Development with the OpenNMS Plugin API

### What is it?
Creating add-ons or extensions for OpenNMS using a standardized method.

### Why do it?
- Add new features to OpenNMS without changing its core
- Customize OpenNMS for specific needs
- Share new functionality with the OpenNMS community

### In simple terms:
It's like creating new apps for a smartphone. Plugins add new features or capabilities to OpenNMS without changing its basic structure.

## 9. AMQP Integration

### What is it?
Connecting OpenNMS with AMQP (Advanced Message Queuing Protocol), a system for passing messages between different parts of a network.

### Why implement it?
- Improve communication between OpenNMS and other systems
- Enable more efficient handling of large amounts of data
- Allow for more flexible system architectures

### In simple terms:
This is like setting up a sophisticated mail system for OpenNMS, allowing it to send and receive messages more efficiently with other parts of your IT infrastructure.

## 10. InMemory Ticketer

### What is it?
A simple ticket management system that runs within OpenNMS's memory.

### Why use it?
- Quick setup for testing or small deployments
- Understand how ticketing works in OpenNMS
- Basis for developing more complex ticketing integrations

### In simple terms:
It's like having a basic notepad for keeping track of issues, built right into OpenNMS. It's simple but useful for learning or in small setups.

## 11. Jasper Report Guideline Design and Style Guidelines

### What is it?
Rules and best practices for creating reports in OpenNMS using Jasper Reports.

### Why follow them?
- Ensure consistency across different reports
- Make reports easier to read and understand
- Improve the overall quality and professionalism of OpenNMS reports

### In simple terms:
These are like a style guide for creating reports, ensuring that all reports in OpenNMS look professional, consistent, and are easy to understand.
