# OpenNMS Events and Alarms: A Simple Summary

## Events

Events in OpenNMS are like notifications or messages about things happening in your network.

### Event Daemon Configuration

What it is: The Event Daemon is like the postmaster of OpenNMS, managing how events are processed.

How it works:
1. It receives events from various sources.
2. It decides what to do with each event based on rules.
3. It can create alarms, notify users, or trigger other actions.

In simple terms: Think of it as a smart mailroom that sorts incoming messages and decides what to do with each one.

### Event Translator

What it is: A tool that can change how events look or behave before they're processed.

How it works:
1. It can modify event details like severity or description.
2. It can create new events based on existing ones.
3. It helps customize event handling without changing the original event sources.

In simple terms: It's like having a translator who can not only translate languages but also rewrite messages to make them more useful for your team.

### Sources of Events

These are the different places events can come from, such as:
1. Network devices (through SNMP traps)
2. Syslog messages
3. OpenNMS itself (internal events)
4. Custom applications

In simple terms: Think of these as different people who might call your IT help desk - some are employees, some are automated systems, and some might be external partners.

### SNMP Trap Performance Data

What it is: A way to extract performance data from SNMP trap messages.

How it works:
1. It looks for specific information in SNMP traps.
2. It can turn this information into performance metrics.
3. These metrics can be stored and graphed like other performance data.

In simple terms: Imagine some of the calls to your help desk include statistics about how the caller's computer is performing. This feature lets you collect and analyze those statistics.

### Advanced Event Search

A powerful tool to find specific events in your system.

Features:
1. Search by various criteria (time, type, severity, etc.)
2. Use complex logic (AND, OR, NOT)
3. Save and reuse searches

In simple terms: It's like having a super-smart assistant who can quickly find any message in your entire message history based on very specific details you provide.

## Alarms

Alarms are like important alerts that need attention. They're usually created from one or more events.

### Configure Alarms

What it is: Setting up rules for how events turn into alarms.

How it works:
1. Define which events should create alarms.
2. Set alarm severity levels.
3. Configure how alarms clear or escalate.

In simple terms: It's like setting up rules for your team about which types of help desk calls should be treated as emergencies.

### Alarm Lifecycle

The stages an alarm goes through from creation to resolution.

Stages typically include:
1. Creation
2. Acknowledgement (someone is working on it)
3. Resolution
4. Clearing

In simple terms: Think of it as the journey of a problem report, from when it's first reported, through someone working on it, to when it's finally solved.

### Alarm Handling

The process of managing alarms in the system.

Features:
1. Assigning alarms to team members
2. Escalating important alarms
3. Adding notes or updates to alarms

In simple terms: It's like managing a to-do list for your IT team, where you can assign tasks, mark their importance, and add notes about progress.

### Alarm Sounds

Audio alerts for important alarms.

How it works:
1. Different sounds for different types of alarms
2. Can be customized based on severity or type
3. Helps notify operators even when they're not looking at the screen

In simple terms: It's like having different ringtones for different contacts on your phone - you know how important the call is before you even look.

### Alarm History

A record of how alarms have changed over time.

Features:
1. Shows when alarms were created, acknowledged, and resolved
2. Keeps track of who worked on each alarm
3. Maintains a log of all actions taken on an alarm

In simple terms: Think of it as a detailed diary for each problem, showing when it started, who worked on it, and how it was solved.

### Advanced Alarm Search

Similar to Advanced Event Search, but for alarms.

Features:
1. Search by various alarm attributes
2. Use complex search logic
3. Save and reuse searches

In simple terms: It's like having a smart filing system that can quickly find any problem report based on very specific details.

### IFTTT Integration

IFTTT stands for "If This, Then That". It's a way to connect OpenNMS alarms to other systems or services.

How it works:
1. Set up rules like "If a critical alarm occurs, then send a text message"
2. Can integrate with many different services and devices
3. Allows for creative and custom responses to alarms

In simple terms: It's like setting up a chain reaction - when an important alarm happens, it can automatically trigger other actions, even outside of OpenNMS.
