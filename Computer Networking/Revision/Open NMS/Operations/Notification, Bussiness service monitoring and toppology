# OpenNMS Features: A Simple Summary

## Notifications

Notifications are like OpenNMS's way of sending you alerts when something important happens in your network.

### Concepts
- Think of notifications as OpenNMS's alarm system for your network.
- When something goes wrong, OpenNMS can send you an email, text message, or other type of alert.

### Notification Configuration
- This is where you set up the rules for when and how you want to be notified.
- It's like programming your home alarm system to decide when it should alert you and how (loud siren, call to your phone, etc.).

### Notification Commands
- These are the specific actions OpenNMS takes to notify you.
- Examples include sending an email, making a phone call, or sending a text message.

### Bonus Notification Methods
- These are extra ways OpenNMS can notify you, like sending messages to chat applications or paging systems.

### Notification Shell Commands
- These allow OpenNMS to run custom scripts or programs as part of a notification.
- It's like telling your alarm system to not only make noise but also turn on the lights when it detects something.

## Business Service Monitoring

This feature helps you monitor how well your important business services (like email or web applications) are working, not just individual devices.

### Business Service Definition
- This is where you tell OpenNMS what makes up a business service.
- For example, you might define "Email Service" as including your email server, network connection, and storage system.

### Business Service Topology
- This shows how different parts of your business service are connected and depend on each other.
- It's like a map showing how different parts of your business processes are linked.

### Operational Status
- This tells you if your business service is working well, having problems, or completely down.
- It's like a health check for your important business processes.

### Root Cause and Impact Analysis
- This helps you figure out what caused a problem and what effects it might have.
- For example, if your email service is down, it might tell you that it's because of a problem with the storage system, and that it will affect all employees' ability to send emails.

## Topology

Topology in OpenNMS is about understanding and visualizing how your network is connected.

### Topology Map
- This is a visual representation of your network.
- Think of it like a map of your city, but instead of roads and buildings, it shows computers, servers, and how they're connected.

### Asset Topology Provider
- This helps create topology maps based on information about your network devices (assets).
- It's like automatically creating a map of your city based on information about buildings and roads.

### Enhanced Link Daemon
- This is a background process that helps discover and monitor network connections.
- Think of it as a scout that's constantly exploring your network to find new connections or changes.

## Database Reports

- These are detailed reports that OpenNMS can generate from the data it collects.
- It's like getting a comprehensive health report for your network, showing trends, problems, and performance over time.

## Ticketing

- This feature allows OpenNMS to create and manage trouble tickets for network issues.
- It's like having a system that not only detects problems but also starts the process of fixing them by creating work orders.

## Overriding SNMP Client Behavior

- SNMP (Simple Network Management Protocol) is a common way for network devices to communicate.
- This feature lets you customize how OpenNMS talks to devices using SNMP.
- It's like being able to adjust how you communicate with different people (some by phone, some by email) to get the best results.

## DNS Resolver

- DNS (Domain Name System) translates human-readable website names into IP addresses.
- The DNS Resolver in OpenNMS helps it look up these translations quickly and efficiently.
- It's like having a super-fast phone book for your network.

## Telemetry Daemon

- This is a background process that collects and processes detailed performance data from your network devices.
- Think of it as a highly efficient data collector, constantly gathering detailed information about how your network is performing.
