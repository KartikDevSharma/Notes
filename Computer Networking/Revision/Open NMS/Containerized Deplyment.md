# Understanding Containerized Deployment of OpenNMS Horizon for Beginners

## 1. What is Containerization?

Imagine you're moving to a new house. Instead of packing everything loosely in a moving truck, you pack your belongings into standardized shipping containers. These containers are easy to stack, move, and manage. This is similar to how containerization works in software.

In the world of software:
- Your belongings = The OpenNMS Horizon application and all its dependencies
- The shipping container = A software container

Benefits:
- Consistency: OpenNMS will run the same way on any system that can run containers.
- Isolation: The OpenNMS container won't interfere with other software on the same computer.
- Easy deployment: You can quickly set up OpenNMS on different machines.

## 2. What is Docker?

Docker is like a company that standardizes these software "shipping containers" and provides tools to manage them. It's the most popular containerization platform.

In the context of OpenNMS:
- There's a pre-packaged "Docker container" for OpenNMS Horizon.
- This container includes OpenNMS and everything it needs to run.

## 3. What is Kubernetes?

If Docker helps you create and run individual containers, Kubernetes is like a fleet management system for many containers.

Imagine you're not just moving one house, but managing moves for an entire city:
- Kubernetes helps decide which moving trucks (computers) should carry which containers.
- It ensures there are enough containers of OpenNMS running to handle all the network monitoring tasks.
- If a truck (computer) breaks down, Kubernetes automatically moves its containers to other trucks.

For OpenNMS:
- Kubernetes can ensure OpenNMS is always available, even if some computers fail.
- It can automatically scale OpenNMS up or down based on how much network traffic you need to monitor.

## 4. What is Red Hat OpenShift?

OpenShift is like a deluxe version of Kubernetes created by Red Hat. It adds extra features that make it easier to use, especially for businesses.

For OpenNMS:
- If your organization uses OpenShift, it might be easier to deploy OpenNMS there.
- OpenShift provides additional security and management features.

## 5. What is Helm?

If Kubernetes is a fleet management system, Helm is like a standardized set of instructions for setting up specific types of cargo.

In software terms:
- Helm creates "charts" which are like recipes for deploying complex applications on Kubernetes.
- The OpenNMS Helm chart contains instructions on how to set up all the parts of OpenNMS in a Kubernetes environment.

For OpenNMS:
- The Helm chart simplifies the process of deploying OpenNMS on Kubernetes or OpenShift.
- It ensures that all the necessary components of OpenNMS are set up correctly and can communicate with each other.

## 6. Why Use Containerized Deployment for OpenNMS?

1. Scalability: Easily add more OpenNMS instances as your network grows.
2. Consistency: OpenNMS will behave the same way in development, testing, and production environments.
3. Resource Efficiency: Containers use resources more efficiently than traditional setups.
4. Easy Updates: Updating OpenNMS becomes as simple as pulling a new container image.

## 7. Basic Steps for Containerized Deployment of OpenNMS

1. Set up a Kubernetes or OpenShift cluster (this is like setting up your fleet of moving trucks).
2. Install Helm (this is like hiring a master coordinator for your move).
3. Use Helm to install the OpenNMS chart (this is like giving your coordinator the specific instructions for moving OpenNMS).
4. Configure OpenNMS through Kubernetes (this is like arranging your furniture in the new house).

Remember, containerized deployment is an advanced topic. If you're new to networking and OpenNMS, it's often better to start with a traditional installation on a single computer. As you grow more comfortable with OpenNMS and your monitoring needs increase, you can explore containerization as a more advanced option.
