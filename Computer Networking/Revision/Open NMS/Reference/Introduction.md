# OpenNMS Reference Topics: A Simple Summary

## 1. Configuration

### What is Configuration in OpenNMS?

Configuration is like setting up and customizing OpenNMS to work the way you want it to in your specific network environment.

### How it works:

1. You modify configuration files to tell OpenNMS how to behave.
2. These files control various aspects of OpenNMS, from basic settings to complex monitoring rules.
3. Changes in configuration can affect how OpenNMS monitors, alerts, and reports on your network.

### In simple terms:

Think of configuration as adjusting the controls on a complex machine. You're telling OpenNMS exactly how you want it to watch over your network, what to look for, and how to react to different situations.

## 2. Collectors

### What are Collectors in OpenNMS?

Collectors are like specialized workers in OpenNMS that gather specific types of information from your network devices.

### How they work:

1. Each collector is designed to collect a specific type of data (e.g., SNMP data, JMX data).
2. They regularly check devices and services on your network.
3. The data they collect is stored and used for monitoring and reporting.

### In simple terms:

Imagine collectors as a team of inspectors, each expert in checking a different aspect of your network's health. One might check temperature, another checks power usage, and so on.

## 3. Service Monitors

### What are Service Monitors in OpenNMS?

Service Monitors are components that check if specific services on your network are working correctly.

### How they work:

1. Each monitor is designed to check a specific type of service (e.g., HTTP, DNS).
2. They regularly test these services to ensure they're responding correctly.
3. If a service fails to respond properly, the monitor reports this to OpenNMS.

### In simple terms:

Think of Service Monitors as health checkers for your network services. They're like doctors doing regular check-ups on different parts of your network to make sure everything is functioning as it should.

## 4. Telemetryd

### What is Telemetryd in OpenNMS?

Telemetryd is a system in OpenNMS that handles streaming telemetry data from network devices.

### How it works:

1. It receives continuous streams of data from network devices.
2. It processes this data in real-time.
3. It can handle large volumes of data more efficiently than traditional polling methods.

### In simple terms:

Imagine Telemetryd as a special listener that can understand and process the constant chatter from your network devices, giving you up-to-the-second information about what's happening on your network.

## 5. Ticketer

### What is Ticketer in OpenNMS?

Ticketer is a system that integrates OpenNMS with ticket management systems.

### How it works:

1. When OpenNMS detects an issue, it can automatically create a ticket in your ticketing system.
2. It can update tickets based on changes in the network status.
3. It helps bridge the gap between network monitoring and IT service management.

### In simple terms:

Think of Ticketer as an automatic secretary. When OpenNMS notices a problem, Ticketer makes sure it's properly recorded and tracked in your help desk system.

## 6. Provisioning

### What is Provisioning in OpenNMS?

Provisioning is the process of adding and configuring devices for OpenNMS to monitor.

### How it works:

1. You can manually add devices or set up rules for automatic discovery.
2. OpenNMS learns about the devices and what services they offer.
3. It sets up appropriate monitoring based on the device type and your configuration.

### In simple terms:

Provisioning is like introducing new team members (your network devices) to OpenNMS and telling it how to work with them. It's setting up OpenNMS to properly watch over all parts of your network.

## 7. Daemons

### What are Daemons in OpenNMS?

Daemons are background processes that run continuously to perform various tasks in OpenNMS.

### How they work:

1. Each daemon is responsible for a specific function (e.g., polling, data collection).
2. They run in the background without need for direct user interaction.
3. Together, they handle the core operations of OpenNMS.

### In simple terms:

Think of daemons as a team of diligent workers who are always on the job, each focusing on their specific task to keep OpenNMS running smoothly 24/7.

## 8. Glossary

### What is the Glossary in OpenNMS?

The Glossary is a comprehensive list of terms and definitions used in OpenNMS.

### How it works:

1. It provides explanations for technical terms used throughout OpenNMS.
2. It helps users understand the specific language and concepts of OpenNMS.
3. It's a reference tool for both new and experienced users.

### In simple terms:

The Glossary is like a dictionary specifically for OpenNMS. It helps you understand the "language" of OpenNMS, making it easier to work with and configure the system.
