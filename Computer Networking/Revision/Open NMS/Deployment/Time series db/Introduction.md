# OpenNMS Time Series Databases and Tracing: A Simple Summary

## Time Series Database (TSDB)

### What is a Time Series Database?

A Time Series Database is like a special filing cabinet that's really good at storing and organizing information that changes over time.

### How it works:

1. It stores data points with timestamps.
2. It's optimized for quickly writing and reading time-based data.
3. It can efficiently compress and store large amounts of data.

### Why use a TSDB?

1. Performance: It's fast at handling time-based queries.
2. Storage Efficiency: It can store lots of data without taking up too much space.
3. Time-Based Analysis: It makes it easy to analyze how things change over time.

### In simple terms:

Imagine you're tracking the temperature outside. A Time Series Database is like a magical notebook that automatically records the temperature every minute, can hold years of data, and can quickly tell you things like "What was the average temperature last Tuesday?"

## RRDtool (Round Robin Database tool)

### What is RRDtool?

RRDtool is a specific type of Time Series Database that OpenNMS has traditionally used.

### How it works:

1. It stores data in a circular buffer (like a ring).
2. Older data gets less detailed over time to save space.
3. It's good for storing and graphing time-series data.

### Why use RRDtool?

1. Compact Storage: It keeps database size constant.
2. Built-in Graphing: It can easily create graphs from stored data.
3. Efficient for Regular Measurements: Great for data collected at fixed intervals.

### In simple terms:

Think of RRDtool like a circular notepad. When you fill up the last page, you start writing over the first page, but you summarize the old information instead of erasing it completely. This way, you always have recent detailed data and long-term summaries.

## Newts

### What is Newts?

Newts is another Time Series Database option for OpenNMS, designed to handle larger amounts of data than RRDtool.

### How it works:

1. It uses Apache Cassandra (a powerful database system) for storage.
2. It can store more detailed historical data than RRDtool.
3. It's designed to work well in distributed systems.

### Why use Newts?

1. Scalability: It can handle very large amounts of data.
2. Flexibility: It allows storing more detailed historical data.
3. Performance: It's efficient for large-scale OpenNMS deployments.

### In simple terms:

If RRDtool is like a notepad, Newts is like a huge filing cabinet that can store much more detailed information for a longer time. It's great when you need to keep track of lots of things in great detail over a long period.

## Time Series Integration Layer

### What is the Time Series Integration Layer?

This is like a universal translator for OpenNMS that allows it to work with different types of Time Series Databases.

### How it works:

1. It provides a common interface for OpenNMS to interact with different TSDBs.
2. It allows switching between different TSDB systems without changing OpenNMS itself.
3. It handles the translation between OpenNMS and the specific TSDB being used.

### Why use the Time Series Integration Layer?

1. Flexibility: You can choose the best TSDB for your needs.
2. Future-Proofing: It's easier to adopt new TSDB technologies as they emerge.
3. Consistency: OpenNMS behaves the same way regardless of the underlying TSDB.

### In simple terms:

Imagine you have a universal remote control that can work with any TV. The Time Series Integration Layer is like this remote - it allows OpenNMS to work with different types of Time Series Databases without needing to be reprogrammed for each one.

## Cortex Time Series Plugin

### What is the Cortex Time Series Plugin?

This is a plugin that allows OpenNMS to use Cortex (a powerful, scalable TSDB) for storing and querying time-series data.

### How it works:

1. It connects OpenNMS to a Cortex cluster.
2. It translates OpenNMS data into a format Cortex understands.
3. It allows querying Cortex data from within OpenNMS.

### Why use the Cortex Time Series Plugin?

1. Scalability: Cortex can handle extremely large amounts of data.
2. Cloud-Native: It works well in cloud environments.
3. Advanced Querying: It provides powerful ways to analyze your data.

### In simple terms:

If OpenNMS is like a weather station, and a TSDB is like its storage system, the Cortex plugin is like connecting your weather station to a super-advanced, cloud-based storage system that can handle data from thousands of weather stations at once.

## Set Up Jaeger Tracing

### What is Jaeger Tracing?

Jaeger is a system for tracking the journey of requests as they travel through different parts of your network and applications.

### How it works:

1. It adds small "tags" to requests as they move through your system.
2. It collects these tags to create a map of each request's journey.
3. It provides a way to visualize and analyze these journeys.

### Why use Jaeger Tracing?

1. Troubleshooting: It helps find where problems occur in complex systems.
2. Performance Analysis: It shows where time is spent during request processing.
3. Understanding System Behavior: It provides insights into how different parts of your system interact.

### In simple terms:

Imagine you're tracking a package as it moves through a delivery system. Jaeger Tracing is like having a detailed log of every stop the package makes, how long it spends at each stop, and any issues it encounters along the way. This helps you understand and improve the delivery process.
