# OpenNMS Horizon Troubleshooting: A Simple Summary

## Horizon Startup

### What is Horizon Startup?

Horizon Startup refers to the process of getting OpenNMS Horizon up and running.

### Common issues during startup:

1. Configuration errors
2. Database connection problems
3. Port conflicts
4. Insufficient system resources

### How to troubleshoot:

1. Check configuration files for errors
2. Ensure the database is running and accessible
3. Verify that required ports are available
4. Monitor system resources (CPU, memory, disk space)

### In simple terms:

Think of starting up Horizon like starting a car. If it doesn't start, you might check the fuel (configuration), the battery (database), ensure nothing's blocking the wheels (ports), and make sure you have enough oil (system resources).

## Horizon Log Files

### What are Horizon Log Files?

Log files are like Horizon's diary. They record what's happening in the system, including errors and important events.

### Key log files:

1. `server.log`: General system log
2. `output.log`: Startup and shutdown information
3. `manager.log`: Information about monitored devices
4. `web.log`: Web interface related logs

### How to use log files:

1. Regularly check logs for errors or warnings
2. Use log entries to diagnose problems
3. Look for patterns or recurring issues

### In simple terms:

Imagine Horizon is keeping a detailed journal of everything it does. When something goes wrong, you can read this journal to figure out what happened, when it happened, and possibly why it happened.

## Other Errors

### What are "Other Errors"?

This category includes various issues that might occur during Horizon's operation, beyond startup problems.

### Common types of errors:

1. Monitoring errors (e.g., can't reach a device)
2. Performance issues (e.g., slow response times)
3. Integration problems (e.g., issues with external systems)
4. User interface errors

### General troubleshooting steps:

1. Identify the specific error or problem
2. Check relevant log files for more information
3. Verify network connectivity if it's a monitoring issue
4. Review recent changes that might have caused the problem
5. Consult the OpenNMS community forums or documentation

### In simple terms:

Think of Horizon as a complex machine. Sometimes, different parts of this machine might have problems. The key is to figure out which part is having trouble (by looking at error messages and logs), then focus on fixing that specific part.

## General Troubleshooting Tips

1. Start Simple: Check the basics first (Is everything plugged in? Is the database running?)
2. Be Methodical: Make one change at a time and observe the results
3. Document Everything: Keep notes on what you've tried and the results
4. Use Available Tools: Horizon provides various built-in troubleshooting tools - learn to use them
5. Ask for Help: The OpenNMS community is a great resource if you're stuck

### In simple terms:

Troubleshooting is like being a detective. You gather clues (from logs and error messages), make hypotheses about what's wrong, test these hypotheses one by one, and keep detailed notes of your investigation. And remember, even great detectives sometimes need to consult with others!
