### Introduction to OpenNMS Horizon

**OpenNMS Horizon** is an open-source network monitoring and management platform designed to monitor large networks. It's used by network administrators to monitor the health, performance, and availability of their networks, devices, and services. OpenNMS provides features like service availability monitoring, event management, performance data collection, and automatic device discovery, all aimed at helping network operators maintain the health of their infrastructure.

There are two versions of OpenNMS:
1. **OpenNMS Horizon** – The cutting-edge, community-driven version, updated frequently with new features and improvements.
2. **OpenNMS Meridian** – A more stable version aimed at enterprises needing long-term support and regular security updates.

### Key Features of OpenNMS Horizon

1. **Automated Network Discovery**:  
   OpenNMS can automatically discover devices and services in your network. It uses protocols like ICMP, SNMP, and other mechanisms to discover and monitor network elements, routers, switches, servers, and more.

2. **Fault Management**:  
   OpenNMS can detect when devices or services are down by regularly polling them. When issues arise, it can generate alarms and notify administrators via email, SMS, or other channels. This helps reduce downtime and ensures fast issue resolution.

3. **Performance Monitoring**:  
   OpenNMS collects performance data from various devices using SNMP, JMX, HTTP, and other protocols. It can monitor CPU usage, memory consumption, bandwidth utilization, and much more. These metrics help administrators optimize and troubleshoot network performance.

4. **Service Assurance**:  
   OpenNMS monitors the availability of network services such as DNS, HTTP, FTP, and others. It can check if these services are up and running, and alert you if there is an outage.

5. **Event Management**:  
   Events generated by devices, services, or OpenNMS itself are captured and stored in a centralized system. You can define specific actions based on events, such as opening tickets, sending notifications, or executing scripts.

6. **Customizable Dashboards**:  
   The platform provides a highly customizable web interface. Users can build personalized dashboards that show the health, status, and performance of their network infrastructure in real-time.

7. **Graphing and Reporting**:  
   OpenNMS generates detailed reports and graphs based on the data collected. These reports can show network performance over time, helping administrators make data-driven decisions about network capacity and upgrades.

8. **Distributed Monitoring**:  
   OpenNMS supports distributed monitoring, allowing you to monitor remote locations without needing full instances of OpenNMS at each site. It can aggregate data from multiple sites into a central location.

9. **Scalability**:  
   OpenNMS is designed to scale from small networks with a few nodes to large enterprises with tens of thousands of devices and services to monitor.

### Core Components of OpenNMS Horizon

1. **Polling Subsystem**:  
   The polling system checks whether services are up or down. It sends out pings, HTTP requests, SNMP queries, etc., to verify service availability. If a service fails, OpenNMS raises an alarm.

2. **Event Management System**:  
   The event management system collects events from different devices and services. These events are stored in the database, allowing administrators to review network activity over time.

3. **Data Collection and Storage**:  
   OpenNMS collects performance data using SNMP, WMI, HTTP, and other methods. The collected data is stored in RRD (Round-Robin Database) files, which allow for efficient storage and retrieval of time-series data.

4. **Notifications System**:  
   Based on predefined rules, OpenNMS can send alerts through email, SMS, or other communication methods when issues occur. The notification system is highly configurable, allowing for different actions based on severity or type of issue.

5. **Provisioning System**:  
   OpenNMS supports both manual and automatic provisioning of network devices. Automatic provisioning enables the system to discover and add devices dynamically, while manual provisioning gives administrators control over what to monitor.

### Installation and Configuration

1. **System Requirements**:
   - **Operating System**: Linux-based systems (e.g., CentOS, Debian, Ubuntu)
   - **Java**: OpenNMS is a Java-based application, so a Java Runtime Environment (JRE) or Java Development Kit (JDK) needs to be installed.
   - **PostgreSQL**: OpenNMS uses PostgreSQL as its database backend. You need to install and configure PostgreSQL for OpenNMS to store its data.

2. **Installing OpenNMS**:
   - OpenNMS Horizon can be installed using package managers like `yum` (CentOS/RHEL) or `apt` (Debian/Ubuntu).
   - For example, on a **CentOS system**:
     ```bash
     sudo yum install opennms
     ```

3. **Configuring OpenNMS**:
   After installation, several configuration files control OpenNMS’ behavior. The primary ones include:
   - **`opennms.conf`**: General system configuration.
   - **`poller-configuration.xml`**: Configures how OpenNMS polls for service availability.
   - **`snmp-config.xml`**: Defines SNMP community strings and SNMP-related settings.

   Basic steps to configure OpenNMS include setting up network ranges for discovery, configuring polling and thresholds, and customizing notification rules.

4. **Starting and Stopping OpenNMS**:
   You can start OpenNMS using system commands:
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl start opennms
   ```

   To stop it:
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl stop opennms
   ```

5. **Web Interface**:
   Once OpenNMS is up and running, the web interface can be accessed by navigating to:
   ```
   http://<your_server_ip>:8980/opennms
   ```

   The web interface is where you manage and monitor your network devices, configure settings, and view performance data.

### Working with OpenNMS Horizon

1. **Discovery**:  
   Once installed, OpenNMS can automatically discover devices using ICMP and SNMP. You can also add devices manually if needed.
   
2. **Creating Monitoring Policies**:  
   Monitoring policies can be created to specify what services and devices OpenNMS should check. For example, you can create policies to monitor CPU usage on certain servers or the availability of web services.

3. **Setting Thresholds**:  
   You can set thresholds on performance data to trigger alarms. For example, if CPU usage exceeds 90% for a certain period, OpenNMS can send an alert.

4. **Configuring Notifications**:  
   Notifications can be set up to alert network administrators via email, SMS, or other methods when critical events occur. You can also specify escalation rules, ensuring that if an issue isn’t resolved in a certain timeframe, the alert is escalated to higher-level support.

5. **Viewing Alarms and Reports**:  
   Alarms are displayed in the web interface and can be acknowledged, cleared, or escalated. Reports can be generated to provide insights into network performance, including availability reports, performance trends, and SLA compliance.

### Integration with Other Tools

OpenNMS supports integration with various third-party tools and platforms:
- **Grafana**: For advanced graphing and visualization.
- **Prometheus**: To pull in Prometheus metrics for display in OpenNMS.
- **Nagios**: Integration with Nagios to extend monitoring capabilities.

### Community and Support

- **OpenNMS Community**: The OpenNMS Horizon project is community-driven, and you can find documentation, forums, and chat channels for support.
- **Documentation**: The official OpenNMS Horizon documentation provides detailed installation and configuration guides. You can refer to it for advanced setups or troubleshooting.
- **Commercial Support**: For enterprises requiring professional support, OpenNMS provides commercial support options through the Meridian version.

### Conclusion

OpenNMS Horizon is a powerful and flexible tool for network monitoring. It is ideal for IT professionals and network administrators who need to keep an eye on network health, performance, and availability. Though OpenNMS has a bit of a learning curve, it is highly customizable and can scale to monitor networks of all sizes.

By leveraging its event management, fault monitoring, and performance data collection features, OpenNMS helps ensure that your network operates smoothly and any issues are identified and resolved quickly.
