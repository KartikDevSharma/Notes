    "### Comprehensive Guide to Azure Policies\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Introduction\n",
    "Azure Policies are a powerful tool for managing and enforcing organizational standards and ensuring compliance across your Azure environment. They help you control and manage the resources in your Azure environment by creating, assigning, and managing policies that enforce rules and effects over your resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What Are Azure Policies?\n",
    "Azure Policies allow you to create policies that enforce rules and effects on your resources. These policies help ensure that your resources stay compliant with your company's standards and service level agreements.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Features**:\n",
    "- **Policy Definitions**: Rules and conditions that describe the resource compliance.\n",
    "- **Policy Assignments**: Application of policies to specific scopes like subscriptions, resource groups, or management groups.\n",
    "- **Initiatives**: Collections of policies grouped together to achieve a single goal.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Core Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Policy Definition**\n",
    "- **Definition**: A policy definition is a statement that describes the desired condition of your resources.\n",
    "- **Structure**:\n",
    "  - **Parameters**: Variables that can be used in the policy rule.\n",
    "  - **Policy Rule**: Contains the `if` and `then` logic.\n",
    "  - **Effect**: The action taken when the policy rule matches (e.g., deny, audit, append, deployIfNotExists).\n",
    "\n",
    "Example Policy Definition:\n",
    "```json\n",
    "{\n",
    "  \"policyRule\": {\n",
    "    \"if\": {\n",
    "      \"field\": \"location\",\n",
    "      \"notIn\": [\"eastus\", \"westus\"]\n",
    "    },\n",
    "    \"then\": {\n",
    "      \"effect\": \"deny\"\n",
    "    }\n",
    "  },\n",
    "  \"parameters\": {},\n",
    "  \"displayName\": \"Allowed locations\",\n",
    "  \"description\": \"This policy restricts the locations to East US and West US.\"\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Policy Assignment**\n",
    "- **Assignment**: Applying a policy definition to a specific scope.\n",
    "- **Scope**: The level at which the policy is applied (management group, subscription, resource group).\n",
    "- **Assignment Properties**: Include the policy definition, scope, exclusions, and parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Initiatives**\n",
    "- **Definition**: A collection of multiple policies aimed at achieving a comprehensive goal.\n",
    "- **Advantages**:\n",

    "        \"parameters\": {}\n",
    "      }\n",
    "    ]\n",
    "  }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Effects of Azure Policies\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Deny**\n",
    "- Prevents a resource request that violates the policy from being created or updated.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Audit**\n",
    "- Allows the resource request but logs the event for further investigation.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Append**\n",
    "- Adds additional fields to the resource request to enforce compliance.\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. AuditIfNotExists**\n",
    "- Audits if a resource that should exist does not.\n",
    "\n",
    "**5. DeployIfNotExists**\n",
