    "\n",
    "3. **DNS Configuration**\n",
    "   - To verify ownership of your custom domain and to route traffic to your Azure App Service, you need to configure specific DNS records at your domain registrar.\n",
    "\n",
    "   **Types of DNS Records**:\n",
    "   - **CNAME Record (Canonical Name)**\n",
    "     - **Usage**: This is the most common DNS record used to map a subdomain (e.g., `www.yourcompany.com`) to your Azure App Service.\n",
    "     - **Configuration**: Create a CNAME record that points from your subdomain (e.g., `www`) to your Azure App Service domain (e.g., `yourapp.azurewebsites.net`).\n",
    "   - **A Record (Address Record)**\n",
    "     - **Usage**: An A record maps a domain or subdomain to a specific IP address. This is used for the root domain (e.g., `yourcompany.com`).\n",
    "     - **Configuration**: Create an A record pointing to the IP address of your Azure App Service. You can find this IP address in the \"Custom domains + SSL\" section of your App Service in the Azure Portal.\n",
    "   - **TXT Record**\n",
    "     - **Usage**: TXT records are often used for domain ownership verification by Azure.\n",
    "     - **Configuration**: Create a TXT record with the name and value provided by Azure during the custom domain setup process. This verifies that you own the domain and are authorized to link it to your App Service.\n",
    "\n",
    "   **Example DNS Configuration**:\n",
    "   - `CNAME` record: `www.yourcompany.com` → `yourapp.azurewebsites.net`\n",
    "   - `A` record: `yourcompany.com` → `123.45.67.89` (App Service IP address)\n",
    "   - `TXT` record: Name = `awverify`, Value = `yourapp.azurewebsites.net`\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Domain Ownership Verification**\n",
    "   - After configuring the DNS records, return to the Azure Portal and complete the domain verification process. Azure will check the DNS records to confirm that you own the domain.\n",
    "   - Once verified, the custom domain will be linked to your App Service, and your application will be accessible through your custom domain.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **SSL/TLS Certificates for Custom Domains**\n",
    "1. **Overview of SSL/TLS**\n",
    "   - SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) and TLS (Transport Layer Security) are protocols that encrypt data transmitted between users and your web application, ensuring security and privacy.\n",
    "   - **HTTPS**: When SSL/TLS is enabled, your custom domain will use HTTPS, displaying a padlock icon in the browser, indicating that the connection is secure.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Types of SSL Certificates**\n",
    "   - **App Service Managed Certificate**\n",
    "     - **Overview**: Azure provides a free, basic SSL certificate for custom domains in App Service. This is a good option for non-critical applications or internal tools.\n",
    "     - **Limitations**: The certificate only supports Standard (SNI) SSL binding and cannot be used for root domains.\n",
    "   - **Third-Party SSL Certificate**\n",
    "     - **Overview**: For more advanced scenarios, such as securing root domains or using wildcard certificates, you can purchase SSL certificates from third-party providers.\n",
    "     - **Usage**: You will need to upload the certificate to Azure and bind it to your custom domain.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Enabling HTTPS for Custom Domains**\n",
    "   - **Step 1: SSL Binding**\n",
    "     - In the \"Custom domains + SSL\" section of your App Service, click on \"Add binding\" under the SSL certificates section.\n",
    "   - **Step 2: Select Certificate**\n",
    "     - Choose the SSL certificate you want to bind to your custom domain. If using an App Service Managed Certificate, select it from the list.\n",
    "   - **Step 3: Configure HTTPS Only**\n",
    "     - Enable the \"HTTPS Only\" setting to ensure that all traffic to your custom domain is encrypted. This automatically redirects HTTP traffic to HTTPS.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Automatic Certificate Renewal**\n",
    "   - Azure automatically renews the App Service Managed Certificate every 6 months, ensuring that your custom domain remains secure without manual intervention.\n",
    "   - For third-party certificates, you need to manage the renewal process through your certificate provider and update the certificate in Azure before it expires.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Monitoring and Managing Custom Domains**\n",
    "1. **Monitoring Custom Domain Traffic**\n",
    "   - **Application Insights**: Integrate Application Insights with your App Service to monitor traffic, user behavior, and performance metrics specific to your custom domain.\n",

    "\n",
    "4. **Troubleshooting Common Issues**\n",
    "   - **DNS Propagation Delay**: After updating DNS records, it can take some time (up to 48 hours) for the changes to propagate across the internet.\n",
    "   - **SSL Certificate Errors**: If users see security warnings, ensure that the SSL certificate is correctly configured and has not expired.\n",
    "   - **Domain Ownership Verification Failed**: Double-check that the TXT or CNAME records are correct and have propagated. You can use online tools to verify DNS record settings.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Best Practices for Using Custom Domains**\n",
    "1. **Use HTTPS Everywhere**\n",
    "   - Always enable HTTPS for your custom domain to protect user data and maintain trust. Use the \"HTTPS Only\" feature in Azure to enforce this.\n",
    "\n",
